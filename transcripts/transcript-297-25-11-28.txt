WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS: EIGHT INCREDIBLE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Nov 28, 2025

Summary:
Nov 28, 2025 (0:56:28)
The onboard UFO experience is the most extensive and controversial type of UFO encounter. These 
cases strike at the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. They contain the most information about who 
the ETs are, where they come from and why they are here. This alone makes them of crucial importance. 
This episode contains eight cases of this kind. These cases not only have the potential to teach us 
volumes about these strange visitors to our planet; they are also incredibly interesting.

WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS. On the night of November 12, 1968, two boys were walking near their homes in 
Blackwood, New Jersey, when they saw a glowing orb-like object following them. They panicked and 
ran and remembered nothing after this. Years later, one of the witnesses was watching TV, and seeing 
an image of UFO, he not only recalled his childhood sighting, but remembered that they were both 
taken onboard, and physically examined and held a short conversation with strange humanoids.

WE WERE NOT AFRAID. On the night of September 27, 1974, two friends (age 19 and 11) went hunting 
outside of Jindabyne, Australia and saw an odd glowing object sitting in a field. They arrived home 
two hours later than they should have. Years later, the younger witness began meditating and 
recalled what happened during the missing time. He remembered that they were both taken into the 
craft and examined by tall, gray-skinned beings. Following the encounter, he experienced many 
paranormal and psychic events.

COME ONTO THE SHIP. One night in July 1977, William Cole was asleep in bed when he was awakened by 
a disc-shaped craft outside his home in Eliot, Maine. When it started to speak to him telepathically, 
he woke up his girlfriend. She verified the sighting and also received telepathic messages. She went 
to wake up their roommate, while William ran outside. By this time, the craft had landed. A door was 
open in the craft and a ramp led inside. William ran up the ramp into the craft. Suddenly he found 
himself back outside, minutes or hours later. His girlfriend and roommate remembered seeing it, but 
only William recalled going inside it.

NOT A SINGLE DROP OF FEAR. On November 4, 1978, two couples were driving outside Buenos Aires, 
Argentina when a massive disc-shaped craft approached their truck and landed in the road in front 
of them. One of the men recalled that he was invited onboard by a tall blond-haired alien. Inside 
he was surprised to see how bright and large the craft was. He met other aliens and was given a 
tour of the craft. The ETs were very friendly, and the encounter was entirely benevolent.

WHAT WEIRD EYES YOU HAVE! On the night of December 5, 1980, a 13-year-old boy stepped outside his 
home in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Without warning, a disc-shaped craft appeared and struck him 
with a beam of light. The boy was unable to move as he heard a telepathic mumbling in his head. 
He ran inside moments later but learned that at least ten minutes had passed. That night, he dreamed 
that he had been taken onboard and examined by strange-looking beings. Later, hypnosis brought out 
more details. The ETs, he said, were friendly, and told him they would return.

YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER THIS. One evening in August 1984, Blaine woke up to find himself being pulled 
from his bedroom in Beckley, West Virginia, and up into a craft. Inside he was subjected to a 
painful examination by strange ETs. When he protested, the ETs reminded him that when he was a 
young child, Blaine had called out for them to come. Blaine instantly remembered the incident and 
realized that he had asked for this encounter. The ETs apologized for the pain they had caused and 
returned him to his home.

AN OVERWHELMING FEELING OF LOVE AND COMPASSION. On the night of August 25, 1998, a women woke up in 
her home in Columbia, Tennessee to find herself floating out her bedroom window and into a craft 
hovering high in the sky. Inside she was greeted by friendly ETs who radiated love and compassion. 
They conducted a strange examination and the next thing she knew, she was back in bed, convinced 
that she had just had a face-to-face encounter with benevolent ETs.

OUR ALIEN BABY. On November 30, 2014, a woman woke up in her bedroom in Kilgore, Texas to find the 
room filled with light. As it dimmed, she found herself onboard a spacecraft with three short gray 
aliens. They used a strange instrument to pierce her abdomen. Moments later, a praying mantis 
humanoid appeared. Frightened, the witness lost consciousness and woke up back in bed. Days later, 
she learned she was pregnant and had a incredibly unusual pregnancy, and an even more special child.

These ten cases are just the tip of the iceberg. There are many thousands of documented onboard UFO encounters, and there are good indications that they number in the millions. It is time to take these accounts seriously and learn all we can about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs 
and the Paranormal. I truly appreciate it. Very excited about today's episode. I'm going to be 
exploring my favorite aspect of eupfology. This subject is always very popular and it is onboard 
UFO encounters. The title of today's episode is, "We Are Your Friends: Eight Incredible Onboard UFO 
Encounters". I have eight cases today. Two from outside of the United States and six from within 
the United States. Locations include Argentina, Australia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Tennessee, and West Virginia. These cases date from 1977 to 2014. They involve all different types 
of ETs. Some are really interesting and unique interactions. Vast majority of these are fully 
conscious UFO encounters. Only one involves the use of hypnosis and frankly it stands up without 
it. 

These kinds of experiences are not nearly as uncommon as people might think. J. Allen Heinik is 
quoted as saying that one in 40 people have had a UFO encounter. That's actually what got me to 
start asking everyone I know. And I found about four or five people within my own circle of family, 
friends, and co-workers. I've certainly had one. I think my older brother has as well and my younger 
sister. It's funny because in 1991, the Roper organization did a poll and found that one in 50 
people show the markers of having an onboard UFO encounter. So, my point is it's far more common 
and that makes it very important. I think these cases deserve a lot of attention. So, let's just 
get started. 

First case I'd like to talk about today, I call, "We are your friends". This one occurred on 
November 12, 1968 in Blackwood, New Jersey. This is a multiple witness case. It does involve some 
limited amount of physiological reactions, but it's truly an astonishing case because this person 
did recall this without the aid of hypnosis. And it's got some really interesting aspects to it. 
Again, this case involves two witnesses. Only one has come forward, and it took him 42 years to do 
so. He is anonymous, so I'll just call him Aiden. His friend's name is Paul. That is his friend's 
real name. On November 12, 1968, Aiden and Paul were just young kids, and they were out walking 
together in the suburb of Turnerville. This is located in Washington Township, New Jersey, located  immediately north of Blackwood, where they lived. And while walking, they noticed a glowing ball of 
light floating along the tree line. This is at night. Both were puzzled because the object was 
totally silent. They became even more concerned when it seemed to be tracking them, following them 
as they walked. And after a few moments of this, they panicked and quote, "Ran like hell." As Aiden 
says, I do not remember much after that. 

And for 28 years or so, that's where the matter rested, but everything changed when one evening 
Aiden was watching the television show Sightings, which is of course about people who've had UFO 
encounters. The program featured a glowing orb, and that was all it took. As Aiden says, 
bang, I remembered. This time he remembered not only seeing the orb, noticing that it 
was following them and running like hell, but he recalled that it continued to follow him and even 
more. As Aiden says in his own words, "Paul and I ran to the corner of the streets, Whitman Drive 
and Cornwall Terrace." Then a blue light beam came out of the orb and froze us right where we 
stood. The next thing I remember was not being able to move. Like frozen, but not being cold. 
Next, I was on a table flat. I raised my head and saw Paul on the table across the room. However, 
it was unlike any room I have ever been in before or since. It had no walls. A brilliant white light 
was inside it. Two beings were standing over me. I looked at my friend Paul and I saw them leaning 
over him as well. 

Now, Aiden does not describe the beings in any real detail except to say that 
there were four of them. Two by his table and two by Paul's table. Two of the beings were tall 
and two were shorter. And he also said that they were not humanlooking and that he believes they 
were male. The experience all in all, he said, was pretty upsetting. And as he says, as I got upset, 
the taller one standing over me touched my forehead. I went limp as a dish rag and all 
of my thoughts were calmed. So now relaxed, Aiden began to talk to the taller being and asked him, 
"Who are you?" The tall being replied, "We are your friends." Paul asked him, "Why do you look 
so different?" The being just repeated, "We are your friends." So Paul asked him, 
"Why?" And the being replied, "It is necessary." Now, none of this communication was verbal, 
but instead all telepathic, or as Paul says, struggling to verbalize this, not with speech, 
but all mentally. So, he saw the beings near Paul turning him over and yelled out to his friend, 
"Watch out." At this point, the being next to Aiden again touched him on the forehead, 
and Aiden passed out. He woke up shortly later and as Aiden says, "The last thing I remember was him 
telling me never to tell anyone about this." The next thing Aiden knew, as he says, they dropped us 
both off unharmed and fully clothed. 

Aiden later did find a spot or incision on his lower spine, 
which he connects to this experience. But another strange event did occur the day after this 
encounter. Aiden was woken up by the sounds of a military helicopter hovering over his home. So 
he went outside and was confronted by a tall man wearing a black rimmed hat much like a policeman 
would wear, he said. And Aiden asked the man what happened last night. And the man replied, quote, 
"It's not safe, little boy. An escaped convict broke out of jail." Now Aiden doesn't believe 
this. In hindsight, in learning about the subject of UFOs, he now wonders if this was a government 
agent or the so-called men in black. Whatever the case, he is now convinced that he was in 
fact taken on board a craft. He also has vague memories of learning how the ETSs live and says 
that they have no. And as he says, all this information was flooded into me. Says Aiden, 
I had lost time. There is a spot or incision on my lower spine. I am 100% sure of what happened, 
but it took to see it on TV to jog my memory of the event. Years later, curious about what 
his friend Paul remembered, he tracked him down 29 years after the event and learned 
that his friend was now in jail. 

So Aiden wrote a letter to him, not mentioning the UFO incident, 
as he didn't want to ask about it right off the bat. And to his surprise, Paul wrote back. So 
Aiden wrote another letter asking if Paul had any memory of the strange UFO encounter. And weirdly, 
the letter came back unopened with a notice that Paul was quote unable to be found. To me, the most 
interesting aspect of that case is how the witness recalled his encounter. It took him years to 
remember it, but he did spontaneously. And what's so interesting is that it took a trigger or a cue. 
We see this many times. something will remind a person of their encounter and suddenly all the 
memories come flooding back. That's exactly what happened in this case. He also apparently does 
have a mark on his body which helps him to confirm his experience. But it's truly an extraordinary 
encounter of an onboard UFO experience. And there are so many. Let's go to the next one. 

This one is also super interesting. I call this one we were not afraid. This one is another multiple 
witness case which occurred on September 27, 1974 in Jinderine, Australia. This one was professionally 
investigated by an experienced researcher. And it's super interesting to me. The most well, we'll 
get to it, but the most interesting aspect of this case is how the witness was affected afterwards. 
This case comes from prominent Australian UFO researcher Mark Moravec and was published in the 
volume five number five issue of the UFO Research Australia newsletter. The case involves two men 
although only one has come forward and their names are known by the researchers but have not been 
released. So I'll call a primary witness Todd. He was 11 years old at the time of his encounter and 
his friend, age 19, agreed to take him out to go hunting at night in the Snowy Mountains area 
just a few kilometers from Gindabine in New South Wales, Australia. 

It was 9:00 p.m. September 27, 1994, a very cold night. They had been walking around for some time 
when they both noticed a bright white spherical light which appeared to be sitting on the ground 
about 800 m away. Its apparent size was quite large, about twice that of the full moon, but they 
estimated that its actual size was maybe 3 m across, 9 or 10 ft. Although it was very bright, 
strangely, it did not appear to cast much light onto the surrounding environment. So together they speculated about what it might 
be. Perhaps the light from a farmer. They considered going to investigate, but it was too 
cold and a bit too far away. Instead, they just watched it for about a half an hour before leaving 
the area. The next day, they did go back to this site to investigate and were surprised to see that 
there was nothing there. No structures, no roads, no evidence at all that anything had been there. 
But later that night, the two young men were with several other friends in the area when 
they saw the same or similar object again and watched it for more than an hour. But strangely, 
nobody seemed to give the light much attention. 

Now, it was about 9 years after all of this that 
Todd began to have really vivid flashbacks about that night. memories that this was far more than 
just the sighting of an unexplained light, but that it was in fact a spacecraft of some kind, 
that he and his friend had been taken on board and examined by apparent extraterrestrials. Thinking 
back to that evening and piecing together the events, he realized that they had some missing 
time as well. As Todd says, I realized that after seeing the light, there was a time lapse of some 
2 hours. I would remember bits and pieces of our walk, but it was so dreamlike compared to 
the memories I was having. I was not asleep. I saw myself and my friend approached the light. But we 
weren't walking. We were wrapped in a blue light ourselves. So Todd says that they were pulled 
towards this object by this light. And as this was occurring, all the wildlife in the area, which was 
considerable, became completely quiet. In fact, all they could hear was a low whistling hum coming 
from the craft. And as they got closer, a door opened and they saw tall, thin, gray-skinned 
entities floating outside the opening. 

And the next thing Todd knew, they were being taken on 
board. As Todd says, we floated in a doorway into a complex room of tubes and benches. We were laid 
on a table. All the while, tall, thin beings with arms and legs, long fingers with no joints, 
smooth gray skin and smooth noseless faces watched and kind of squirmed like when we are waiting in a 
queue. Todd says that he saw four beings on board. Three examined him while a fourth moved in and out 
of the room as if checking on their progress. He says the beings were over 6 feet tall, very thin 
with bald heads, and where the eyes would be. This is so bizarre. Todd said he saw only quote gray 
bulges. He said that he couldn't see any ears, but that their noses were flat and their mouths were 
slit-like. He couldn't really tell if they were wearing any clothing or not, but if they were, 
it was definitely skin-tight. And although they seemed to float while outside the craft, 
while inside they moved with large steps and were very flexible in their movements. The beings never 
spoke audibly, but it seemed to Todd that they were communicating with gestures. 

He also said that when the beings touched them, he could feel that their hands were very warm. And 
he also got a pretty good look at the room they were in. As he says, the room was gray blue, and a 
bluish light seemed to emanate from the corners of the walls and the ceiling. The room was cramped 
and square. The beings had just enough room to get in between us and around us. They had cream 
colored overhead lights to look at us with. We lay there and we could see them lean over us. They 
hooked up wires to our skin and seemed to be able to pull our clothes open without tearing them. 
They seemed very busy at the time and often would look at each other and pass instruments from one 
another. L says that they also saw benches and cupboards with shelves which held various instruments 
inside the craft. He also noticed what appeared to be a panel of red and yellow lights flashing on 
and off, but the whole purpose of the encounter seemed to be to examine the two young men. As Todd says, 
as far as I could interpret, they were gauging how electromagnetic fields related to my body 
and the atmosphere. 

I remember my friend came around and tried to resist, but they took him 
away only to return him. His eyes were sunken. He was very pale and very cooperative. He passed 
out once he lay down. The tests went on for some time, and after literally hundreds of wires had 
been connected, they just took them off, closed up my clothes, and left us both. We were not afraid, 
but we were not really conscious either. They put us back where we had first seen them, and that was 
that. So Todd estimates that they were on board the craft for about 2 hours. It didn't regain full 
awareness until they walked across a ridge and saw a horse. Now, he did have one bizarre dream 
following all this that he thinks might be related to the encounter because during the time he was 
remembering this event, he dreamt that he and his friend were in the craft and looking outside saw 
that the craft had landed on a pad of ice. Kind of reminded him of the North Pole. Inside the craft, 
he was taken into a strange kind of void where he had a spiritual type experience. He said he 
had the body of a fox and was running around hunting small animals until a man dressed in 
furs grabbed him and pulled him from the snow. 

So that was a dream which he feels was related, 
but he's not sure how it fits in. His recall of the onboard segment, however, came as flashbacks, 
ultimately, was not really a positive experience for him and he said that he felt as if he had been violated and quote used like some specimen and dumped and he became very upset thinking about 
these beings. He believes he was able to recall the experience because at the time he had started 
doing transcendental meditation and this is when all the memories came back. Now, another very 
interesting result of the encounter was that he became interested in the math and physics of time 
and space and of course in UFOs as well. He also reports having strong intuition and premonitions 
of upcoming events and on one occasion saw an apparition of what he believes was a ghost. 
He works as a professional musician and describes himself as a stable, intuitive person with a good 
understanding of human consciousness. Researcher Mark Moravec writes that Todd was quote a sincere 
and stable person with no obvious indication of a hoax or pathological problems. Though Mark, 
the researcher, is not necessarily convinced that this involves a physical onboard experience, the 
witness is. 

He is absolutely convinced that this was a real experience and that he and his friend 
were physically taken on board the craft. Here we have another case of a witness who remembered the 
onboard segment of his encounter years after it occurred and he did it through apparently 
the use of meditation. This is something I always recommend to people who are perhaps 
seeking hypnotic regression. First, write down everything you remember and then try meditating 
to bring back your encounter. And certainly that was successful apparently for this witness. To me, 
another really interesting aspect of this case is how he became so psychically aware following 
his encounter with premonitions and ghost sightings and precognition. This is a very 
prominent pattern among UFO contacties. I think it really speaks to what the ETSs are trying to 
do here, which is wake us up to our own psychic abilities. So, all around interesting case. 

Now, let's move to the next one. This one is again all these cases really interesting, but this one has 
some unique aspects to it. It is technically a single witness case, but there were two other 
people there who saw the UFO, so I'm going to call it a multiple witness case. I call this one come 
into the ship. This one occurred one evening in July of 1977 in Elliot, Maine. As far as I know, 
it hasn't been formally investigated, but it's a really remarkable encounter because this witness 
very nearly did not recall, but he did. The main witness in this case is William Cole. He has come 
forward and allowed his real name to be used. He was about 28 years old at the time of his 
encounter and currently works as a marketing executive. He has a BA in communications and 
philosophy and says that from a very young age, he had always been interested in science and 
space travel, but nothing could have prepared him for the events of one evening in July of 1977.

The encounter began when William woke up in the bedroom of his home in Elliot, Maine, to see 
a strange light behind the trees. His girlfriend was asleep beside him in bed, and looking out the 
window, he was amazed to see a craft rising above the trees and hover there. And as William says, I 
could hear a message in my thoughts that my desire for proof of extraterrestrials had arrived and 
that I was not to tell anyone. It was definitely telepathic communication. And I asked silently 
if I could tell my woman. The reply was something like, "If you want to." So I woke her up and asked 
her to look out the window and tell me what she could see. She described exactly what I saw. Now 
this was so amazing to William that he was still wondering if he might be dreaming and actually 
pinched himself, shook his head, and asked his girlfriend if they might be dreaming. But it was 
clear to them both that they were not. By now, this craft was landing very close to the house 
or coming close to landing. William asked her if she could hear any messages coming from the craft, 
and she replied, "It's telling us not to tell anyone and that we can come onto the ship." 

As William says, "That's what I was perceiving also." So, I jumped out of bed and started putting on my 
clothes. She put her robe on. I was out in the upstairs hall and headed down the stairs. Now, 
at this point, William's girlfriend said that she had to tell her roommate, who was asleep in the 
other room about what was happening. And William shouted out, "Don't do it." And he ran down to the 
first floor and out into the yard to get a closer look at this craft. He could now see that it was 
about 30 ft across, discshaped, dark gray in color with lights around the rim. He did not see any 
landing legs. And as William says, "I saw the ship sitting there. There was an open door with a ramp 
coming out of it. Meanwhile, my girlfriend and roommate were headed downstairs, but I was intent 
on getting onto the vehicle and not violating the beings who had sent the thoughts by not telling 
more people. There was a yellowish light coming from the interior, and I could see a tiled wall 
and what appeared to be a tub filled with liquid at the center of the room. So, at this point, 
William ran up the ramp and into the ship, but as if a switch had been flipped. He had apparent 
missing time. As William says, the next thing I remember was standing back in the house near the 
back door. I rushed back outside and the UFO was lifting off into the air above the yard. The women 
were entering the room from the upstairs by this time, and they joined me outside. As I looked up, 
following its movement high into the air about 150 ft, the object transformed itself into what 
appeared to be a US Army cargo plane, complete with rumbling engine sound, and proceeded away 
from the trees. Our roommates said something to the effect that it was just a plane, and I could 
feel waves of mental energy attempting to block and confuse my mind into a doubtful state. As we 
stood there in the yard, I resolved not to let my memory be blanked out. We all ended up going to 
bed. So the next day, he remembered what happened and they talked about it. William's girlfriend 
said that the whole thing was probably all in their minds. But William hardily disagreed because 
he recalled something which left no doubt in his mind that this experience was physically real. As 
William says, I know it was a physical, material, realtime experience because I ran onto that ship 
with my jeans and a t-shirt on, and I had only underpants on when I found myself back in the 
house minutes or hours later. What happened inside the ship, I cannot recall, but I remember running 
up that ramp. About 28 years after the encounter, William did report his experience to the website 
ufoevidence.org. org. I think that's a good case. True, the witness doesn't really remember any part 
of the actual on board experience, but there's little doubt certainly in his own mind that he 
was taken on board cuz he does remember running into the ship and coming out. His clothes were 
different. So, that's kind of a dead giveaway that happens quite often. People will come back from an 
encounter and perhaps their clothes are inside out or even they're wearing someone else's clothes. 
It's so interesting to me that he came very close to not remembering any of it, but ultimately did 
remember. So, this again illustrates how there can often be memory problems associated with UFO 
encounters. always makes me wonder how many people have had an onboard encounter and don't even 
remember it. I'm guessing a lot. Let's move to the next case. This one is really interesting to me 
because it was entirely benevolent and in fact I call this one not a single drop of fear. That is a 
direct quote from the primary witness. This case occurred on November 4, 1978 outside of Buenes 
Aris, Argentina. This does involve four witnesses, though apparently only one was taken on board, 
and he got to meet human-looking ETSs. While this case does involve four witnesses, apparently only 
one of them recalls being taken on board. He is anonymous, so I'll just call him Phipe. Summer in 
Argentina actually runs from December to February, and it was a clear summer night on November 4, 
1978. Phipe and three other friends were driving in a truck in the Buenes ARS area of Argentina. 
Phipe sat in the back seat directly behind the driver. He was looking out the side window when he 
noticed a strange object hovering low in the sky. It was actually moving slowly and looked to be 
about 100 to 150 ft high off the ground. The craft was round and he estimates that it was about 200 
to 300 ft in diameter. As Philippe says, "I told my friend and we passed by the path of the UFO and 
stopped in the middle of the road." The UFO was at that time in the 8:00 position, meaning due west, 
and was descending and approaching very slowly to our location. It was huge and soundless. I 
could see an entity in the lower level. In the middle level, lights were spinning with different 
colors. When the UFO was getting closer, a yellow light was lighting the area. was kind of a cloudy 
yellow. We were observing the UFO until it stopped above our heads, no more than 30 feet high. Now, 
at this point, the encounter was just a simple sighting, but it was now about to escalate from 
a close encounter of the first kind to a close encounter of the fourth kind, being taken on board 
an extraterrestrial craft. Because as Phipe says, the next thing I remember was me getting up into 
the craft in a sort of spiral steps escorted by an alien behind me. I think to the second level, 
an alien almost 7t tall with blonde hair and a colorful tight uniform was standing up right in 
front of me on my right side when I reached the floor level. His head was kind of an upside down 
conicle shape. He looked at me with a friendly attitude for a moment and then he kept on doing 
whatever he was doing. I saw another entity far away from me on the left side also engaged in 
other activity. The room was wide and spacious and kind of self-illuminated. The ceiling had a dome 
shape and the color was an intense blue similar to the sky you can see in the early morning high 
in the mountains. The one who was escorting me took me across the room and introduced me 
to a fourth alien. He was sitting down and greeted me with a friendly approach. Now, 
Philipe did not see any of his friends on board the craft, or at least he didn't say he saw them, 
but nor was he the least bit afraid. As he says, I remember not having a single drop of fear. He, 
meaning the extraterrestrial who was escorting him around the craft, talked to me for a while. 
I could feel how we were moving. I do not know if we were flying or just floating. And after that 
point, I cannot remember anything else. Philipe did not report on what the ETSs told him or if 
his friends had any memory beyond just seeing the UFO. Such an amazing case. It's interesting 
because the vast majority of people who are taken on board do report being physically examined. He 
does not. Basically, he was taken on board and given a tour of the craft. I find that really 
interesting. Certainly, people who do not react with fear or panic often are given a tour of the 
craft and the ETs will communicate with them. But when people do react with panic, often that's when 
they will have missing time because I don't think it's the ET's goal to scare people, harm them in 
any way. The evidence does not support that. So that I think is a very interesting case because 
it illustrates this thing that happens to so many people when they're taken on board. All right, 
let's move to the next case. This one I thought was really profound. I call this one What weird 
eyes You Have. The witness in this case is just a young teenager. He clearly had quite a traumatic 
encounter, but it's super interesting. It occurred on December 5, 1980 in Foxboro, Massachusetts. And 
this one was thoroughly investigated and has physical evidence that really supports the 
veracity of this encounter. This case was reported directly to researcher Raymond Fowler minutes 
after it occurred. He handed it over to researcher Joseph Nyman, the Massachusetts chief investigator 
from MUON, and Mufon field investigator Edwin W. Fog Jr. The witness is a 13-year-old boy whose 
identity remains a secret, so I'll just call him Steve. That is a pseudonym. It was a bitterly cold 
evening around 6:30 p.m. as Steve prepared to go to a boy scout meeting near his home in Foxboro, 
Massachusetts. He stepped outside to check on his dirt bike and to make sure that the ground 
was not too frozen for him to ride the bike. As he was bending over the ground, he suddenly heard 
a very strange whistling or humming noise, which he said was very similar to the sound of someone 
rubbing their finger on the rim of a wine glass. And looking up towards the source of the noise, 
he immediately saw a saucer-shaped object hovering about 50 ft overhead. He estimates that it was 
about 35 ft in diameter. It had glowing port holes situated around the edge of the craft. 
and he says it was quote bigger than a house. Now almost immediately it sent down a beam of 
light from its base striking Steve directly on the chest and Steve says that he felt a tingling 
sensation in his legs and discovered that he was unable to move. He's really not sure how long he 
was in this beam of light. But during this time, he heard a strange quote mumbling in his head. And 
he felt as if someone was trying to communicate with him telepathically, but he just couldn't 
understand what they were saying. He felt like he had lost normal consciousness. And at some point, 
the beam retracted, the paralysis lifted, the craft flew away, and Steve ran into the house 
screaming to his mother that he had just seen a UFO. So, she estimates that he was outside 
for about 10 minutes, and she had no doubt that Steve had seen something very unusual because, 
as she says, he was as white as a ghost. She herself believed strongly in UFOs and in the past 
had actually worked directly with investigator Raymond Fowler and with Muon. So it was now time 
for Steve to go to his boy scout meeting. So he left. Meanwhile, his mother contacted Raymond 
Fowler and told him what happened. Raymond Fowler immediately called Joseph Nyman and 
Edwin Fog. The two men called the police to see if there were any UFO reports from anyone else, 
but apparently there were not. They then headed over to the family's house to interview Steve 
directly. This is still the same night of the encounter. So getting there, Steve reported 
what happened and after hearing about the beam of light striking his chest. The investigators asked 
if they could examine him physically. So Steve removed his shirt and everyone was amazed to 
see a marking similar to a sunburn, which you can see here. It ran from the top of his breast bone, 
tracing a narrow line under both sides of his rib cage, kind of like an upside down T-shape. The 
investigators asked and were granted permission to take a photograph of this strange burn mark, 
which was very similar to a sunburn. The boy said that there was no pain whatsoever associated with 
this mark. Now, Steve's parents knew that he would often talk in his sleep, particularly about events 
that had upset him during the day. So, when Steve went to sleep a few hours later at 11:15 p.m., 
his parents were not surprised when he started mumbling about his encounter. His father quickly 
grabbed a tape recorder and recorded what the boy was saying. And the boy said, quote, "Oh no, what 
the hell? It's a UFO. What's happening? I don't want to go on. Don't do any more tests on me." 
Oh no, no, no. Don't do any more tests. Who are you? Are you an Earth person? Later that night, 
he spoke again in his sleep, saying, "No more tests. I have to get home. I'll be late for my 
scout meeting." "Boy, what weird eyes you have. What weird hands." So, waking up in the morning, 
the boy had no memory whatsoever of talking in his sleep. But in the days that followed, 
something else happened. Weird poltergeistike activity began to occur in the house. 
These included lights going on and off, water faucets turning on and off, small objects moving 
by themselves, and it was clear to everyone that the boy himself was quote the agent and that it 
was connected to his UFO encounter. Meanwhile, Steve was having flashbacks of being on board, 
strange dreams, anxiety, and a fear of going outside at night. So, a few months later, 
Steve agreed to try hypnotic regression to recall further details of his encounter and going under 
hypnosis. He did recall going outside, seeing the UFO, being struck by the beam of light, 
and immobilized. He heard the mumbling in his head. However, now under hypnosis, 
he not only understood what was being said to him, he remembered being taken on board. As Steve says, 
something's telling me something. It's a calm voice running through my mind, soothing me. I 
don't understand. The ship comes closer. I'm able to run. I hit the baseball bat and fall down. I 
look up. It's looking at me. Something's looking at me still. No one could hear me. This is it. 
The light gets really intense. I won't be harmed. They're just going to examine me. It's a person. 
He has a big head, a small body. He's floating across the window of the ship. It's talking and 
looking at me. Then it stops. I can't understand it. I run and it just stays where it is. His eyes 
are big, nose long, no mouth. Now, despite his fear, Steven says that the aliens were quote 
friendly, that they just quote wanted to examine him. Writes researcher Joseph Nyman. Two or three 
beings apparently ran medical tests on him. The most amazing thing you hear from these tapes is at 
the end of their conversation, the aliens tell the boy, "They'll be back." The investigators learned 
at the time of the encounter that the mother was in the middle of a custody battle for her son with 
the boy's natural father. So, it was clear to the investigators that there was no motive for a hoax 
because the family was very concerned about any publicity. So they were convinced of the 
genuiness of this case. As researcher Joseph Nyman writes, "Now more than 17 years after the events, 
I am more than ever convinced of their reality and the case's importance of my own understanding 
of the nature of the UFO experience." Such an amazing case. And you can see that although 
the witness did undergo hypnotic regression, it stands up quite easily without it. And although 
he felt it was somewhat traumatic, he ultimately concluded that the ETSs were in fact friendly. So 
that is a pattern I see with most contacties. It can be quite scary, but it becomes clear to the 
witnesses that the ETSs are not trying to harm them or frighten them and ultimately often it 
just comes down to physical checkup. That seems to be the purpose of quite a few encounters. 
Now, let's move to the next one, which definitely fits this pattern as well. I call this one, you 
will not remember this. This occurred one evening in August of 1984 in Beckley, West Virginia. It 
is a single witness case. It hasn't been formally investigated as far as I know, but it's certainly 
a compelling firstirhand eyewitness testimony of what it's like to be taken on board and undergo 
a physical examination by extraterrestrials. The witness in this case is anonymous, so I've given 
him the pseudonym Blaine. He reported his case to the National UFO Reporting Center in New Fork 
about 15 years after it occurred, writing that he is quote a non-smoker, non-drinker, 
and I did and do not use drugs. At the time of his encounter, he was about 21 or 22 years old, 
living with his parents in their home in Beckley, West Virginia. And I'll just let Blaine describe 
what happened. As he says, "I had just laid down when I heard a high-pitched worring sound. Then 
an extremely bright light came through my window. I can remember grabbing my bed and trying to hold 
on because it felt like I was being absorbed into the light. The next thing I remember, I was lying 
on a bed or a table. The feel and look of the table was cold and it had a gray porcelain look 
to it. It did not have legs, but the base came from the floor. I was covered with a thin silver 
blanket. It did not feel as if it were made from cloth. There were several beings standing beside 
the table. I believe two on one side and three on the other. On the side with the three beings, 
one stood by my head and tried to calm me as the others performed the procedures. He seemed to 
communicate telepathically. I do not remember him speaking to me directly. Now, the EETs appear to 
be grays, although as Blaine says, I'm not sure of the color. Blaine says they were of medium 
height with two elongated eyes and a slit for a mouth. The ET standing next to him continued to 
speak telepathically and told him, "You will not remember this. You will not be harmed. We are not 
trying to hurt you." However, as they proceeded to examine him, Blaine does report feeling some pain. 
As Blaine says, I remember this light above my head. It started at my head and slowly and 
extremely painfully moved down my body. I felt like I was being rolled by a rolling pin. When 
it got to my feet, I was in a lot of pain. I remember feeling like I was going to puke 
as I was being told that they were going to make one more pass back up to my head. At that point, 
I began pleading to be let go, that it was too painful and I could not take it. So at this point, the being that was communicating with him and was reassuring him began to speak to 
one of the other beings who Blaine perceived to be the one in charge of the encounter. And Blaine 
had the impression that they were having a quote heated argument. Then the being by his head turned 
to Blaine and said something which shocked him. As Blaine says, he turned to me and told me that 
years earlier I had asked them to come and that I would not resist. So Blaine's mind whirled with 
this information because he knew exactly what the being was talking about. As Blaine says, 
"Years earlier, I remember yelling into the sky with a friend and I wanted to meet the aliens 
and I would be willing to be examined in a UFO and now they were doing it." And he said I was whining 
about it. A few more words were exchanged with the boss and the light began its trip back up. 
Now, the being who was comforting Blaine then told him, "We are very sorry if we harmed you 
and scared you." That was enough for Blaine to become emotionally overwhelmed, and he believes 
that his fear of what was happening cut the encounter short. As Blaine says, I lost it. I 
think they put me back before they had finished. I remember feeling the beam place me back in bed, 
and as I looked up, the light left my room. I was scared. I ran to my parents' room crying 
and I went to some of the windows in the house to look outside. Lane searched to see if there 
was any UFO in the sky, but he apparently did not see anything. And unfortunately, 
his parents did not believe him and just dismissed his story. But before long, Blaine was vindicated 
and received some level of confirmation of his experience because, as he says, a few days later 
on the news, a UFO was reported to have been seen in a city that was close to where I live. 
So this experience, as you can imagine, changed the way Blaine feels about UFOs and aliens. And 
today he has learned to live with his encounter as best as he can. As he says, I have told only 
a few people, but we joke about it. However, I am tired of joking about it because it did happen. I 
remember it and I've tried to avoid reading or watching anything that might embellish my 
abduction. I try to be calm and remember as much of it as I could because I knew no one 
would believe me. How interesting is that case? Yes, in many ways it is fairly typical. But what 
I find most interesting about that case is how the witness as a young man basically asked for an 
encounter called out to them. And apparently the ETSs remembered this because they brought it up. 
Technically, this would be categorized as a close encounter of the fifth kind, human initiated, 
because he asked for an encounter and he got it. I guess the old adage, be careful what you wish for, 
is true. An amazing encounter. Now, let's move to the next one, which I call an overwhelming 
feeling of love and compassion. This occurred on August 25, 1998 in Colombia, Tennessee. 
This case is so interesting to me because this witness really had an amazing emotional 
reaction to her encounter. This case comes from an anonymous witness who reported her encounter about 
15 years after it occurred. She did provide her firsthand written testimony of what she believes 
was an onboard UFO encounter. For the purpose of this presentation, I've given her the pseudonym 
Charlotte. Her encounter occurred on August 25, 1998, where she was taken from her bedroom of her 
home in Colombia, Tennessee. As Charlotte says, I was in bed asleep and awoke to floating out my 
bedroom window. The wind was blowing my gown. I saw myself at the treetops and reached to a limb 
to grab some leaves. They fell from my hand. I then realized a light was towards where I was 
floating. I looked to the path I was floating and I saw a discshaped object above the trees. I was 
floating closer to the beam of light that was emitting from the bottom of the disc and I was 
taken on board the craft. Now, Charlotte does not describe actually entering the craft. This 
is a phenomenon that researchers call doorway amnesia. Often people find themselves being 
pulled up towards a craft and suddenly they're inside it. And this is exactly what Charlotte 
says happened to her. says Charlotte. The next thing I knew, I was on a table in a round room 
was very white in the room, and the light was of better quality than I have ever seen. I then 
saw three humanlike creatures. One was below my feet, the second was at my right near my legs, 
and the third was at my left and up closer to me. I looked around at them. Then the one on 
my left took my hand. I was not afraid. I had an overwhelming feeling of love and compassion from 
this entity. We looked at each other in the eyes and I felt totally relaxed and at ease. Suddenly, 
a fourth entity came in that was taller than the rest. He came to my right side just as a surgeon 
would do, the one at the right of me that was at my legs, placed a thing on the fourth one's head. 
Now, the device kind of reminded Charlotte of the children's toy, a view master, 
which allows the user to see various illuminated pictures. But seeing what happened next, 
it was clear to Charlotte that this instrument was a medical examination tool of some kind. Because, 
as Charlotte says, the taller one that had the gadget on his head pulled it down over his eyes, 
then bent down over my chest, and a small red beam emerged from the gadget and hit my chest. I felt 
pain, and I could not breathe. I felt like I was passing out. I looked so closely into the eyes 
of the one that was the tallest, which I call the surgeon, and so closely into the eyes of the one 
on my left, which I call the anesthesiologist. I know they did not look like eyes. They looked 
like lenses of some sort. So, this marked the end of Charlotte's onboard experience, or at least 
her memory of it. If anything else happened, she doesn't remember it. As Charlotte says, 
"The next thing I know, I awake in my bed sweating and feeling panic." Now, at first, Charlotte told 
only a few people, but later felt that it was very important to report it officially. She has 
learned that some people are skeptical, but she is convinced that she was taken on board a craft and 
saw extraterrestrials who performed some kind of tests on her. As Charlotte says, I have not 
shared this story to but a few people, some of who looked at me like I was crazy. Some people 
have told me it was just a dream, but I feel it was real. I will always believe it was real. 
I will never forget it. I know that for sure. I wonder how many times this has happened to me, and 
I don't remember. And what else have they done? What I find interesting about that case is that 
the witness really had difficulty processing it, trying to figure out was this a dream? Could this 
have been a real experience? Obviously, she does think it's real because she reported it that way. 
Also super interesting is that she felt incredible love and compassion coming from these beings. This 
is reported far more often than you might think. It's funny because sometimes people will report, 
"Ah, these ETs weren't very emotional." I think those are probably the little small short grays, 
which I think honestly are what we would call biological androids, AI, who aren't emotional, 
are not born, don't die. They're essentially biological machines. So, it makes sense that 
they wouldn't have strong emotions. But yes, ETSs absolutely do have emotions and very commonly 
people will report feeling an incredible sense of love coming from them. It's truly an astonishing 
case and I'm glad the witness had the courage to report it in the face of this hostile climate 
of skepticism and disbelief and ridicule and gaslighting because again so many people are 
having these experiences and only very few are coming forward. Now let's move to the last and 
final case which to me is probably my favorite in this collection. This one is just really profound 
for a number of reasons. I call this one Our alien baby. This one occurred on November 30th, 
2014 in Kilgore, Texas. I think you'll find it a particularly fascinating and compelling case. 
The vast majority of people who have an onboard encounter do request anonymity, and this case 
is no exception. It involves a woman I'll call Kathleen. Again, that is a pseudonym. At the time 
of her encounter, she was living with her husband and young son in a rented home on a very large 
lot in the middle of the small town of Kilgore, Texas. Her husband had recently left the state for 
his job, so Kathleen was alone with her son, and the only neighbors around were the landlords who 
lived nearby on the same property. On the evening of November 30, 2014, she had put her son to sleep 
and then went to sleep herself. And that night she had a very vivid and unusual dream. At least 
that's what she thought it was at first. Later she changed her mind because as Kathleen says, 
in the dream there was a bright light, so bright that at first I couldn't see anything. It slowly 
dimmed and I noticed right away I was strapped to a table and a medical gown of sorts. The table I 
was strapped to had broken apart for each of my limbs. So, my legs were spread and my arms were 
spread, kind of like an X shape with an extended part for my head to lay. I realized I couldn't 
move or speak at all, and I started to panic. But a female voice calmly assured me that I was going 
to be okay and they weren't going to hurt me. I didn't hear a voice as if spoken out loud. It was 
only in my head. I don't know how because I could not see her, but I felt her standing right behind 
me. Off to the right of me stood three little gray beings, maybe three to four feet tall. The typical 
looking grays society knows. So at this point, the grays started to examine her body, touching her 
and performing some kind of procedure. As Kathleen says, I assumed the female being had given them 
instructions I didn't hear because they started touching me and although I couldn't feel it, 
I could see them. One came around the table to my left and opened my gown so my stomach 
was exposed. One of the ones on my right stood there while the other pulled something towards 
me. It was a machine of some sort. When I looked up, I saw a metal ring and in the middle of it 
was a needle. The machine lowered and the needle extended and they hovered it right over my navl. I 
didn't feel it, but I saw it when the needle went straight into my belly button. The female voice 
kept assuring me that they weren't hurting me. And for some reason, I believed her. I don't know why. 
Once they were done with whatever they were doing, they closed my gown. Now, at this point, Kathleen 
had seen only the small grays, but now she saw a being, which was very different looking and 
quite frightening for her. As Kathleen says, I was able to look down towards the end of the table, 
and I saw a massive creature that horrified me. It was so tall that its head was ducked so that 
it didn't touch the metal ceiling. was light and dark brown with some black patterns here and there 
on its body. And it had a face that I can only compare to the head of a praying mantis, though 
it had a normal body with a normal torso, arms, and legs. It also had these extended appendages 
like spider legs that jutted out from both sides of him. So, at this point, Kathleen blacked out, 
and the next thing she knew, it was morning. She got up and fed her son. She lay him down for his 
nap and went to take a shower. still thinking about this quote dream. While in the shower, she 
was washing her navl and this is when she noticed a little scab. Puzzled, she picked at it and it 
started to bleed a little bit. And as Kathleen says, there was no explanation as to why it could 
have been there. I had never had any surgeries or anything in my life, especially within my belly 
button. I called my husband and told him about the dream, and he agreed it sounded crazy. Now, 
it was just a short time later that Kathleen and her husband got amazing news. As Kathleen says, 
it was about a month later that we found out we were 6 weeks pregnant with our second son. Now, 
Kathleen feels certain that there is a connection between our second son and the alien encounter. As 
she says, to this day, he is extremely smart, almost a genius, we'd say. And we don't say 
that just because he is our son. We joke to each other all the time about how he is our alien baby 
because we honestly feel like they did something to our pregnancy. Kathleen says that her blood 
type is Rh negative and she was surprised to hear that many contactes have the same blood type. She 
later had two other children and realized that the pregnancy with her second son was far different 
than the three others. As Kathleen says, I have major complications with my pregnancies. I have 
four children and three of the pregnancies were horrible due to my health issues from my blood 
type. I had to take Rogam shots to ensure my baby's safety so my body wouldn't kill it. My 
second son's pregnancy was the only one I did not have to take medications or shots with. He was the 
only healthy pregnancy I've had. So Kathleen now feels the urge to talk to others about her case 
and recently reported it to Muon and elsewhere. As Kathleen says, I was invited to talk on a podcast 
about my encounter, and I did just that, to spread awareness and share my story. I've met others with 
similar stories since then. I waited too long to share my story because those closest to me that 
I did tell thought I was crazy and didn't believe me and shrugged it off as if it was nothing. Well, 
interesting is that. It does appear that the ETSs intervened with this woman's pregnancy, 
it being the only pregnancy of four, which was actually caused her no problems. It's really 
interesting because she has the Rh negative blood type, which does seem to be a bit more prominent 
among the contact population. But yeah, she had really difficult pregnancies with all the other 
children except this one. she had physical evidence that there was an encounter. So, 
I do think that she was absolutely taken on board and this wasn't a dream, particularly because how 
her baby turned out to be a little bit different from all the others. Yes, I think they are to some 
extent joking when they say, "Oh, he's our alien baby." But we see this pattern over and over again 
with people who are taken on board while they're pregnant and then the baby comes out and he's 
just a little bit more psychic or intelligent or outgoing than the other children in the family. 
So I find that case to be particularly interesting for those reasons because it's a pattern we see so 
often. So there you go, eight cases of onboard UFO encounters. I'm sure there are millions of 
people who are having this experience all over the world and yes they can be frightening but as these 
cases show I think if you take an objective look not through the lens of fear disregarding your 
prior beliefs about what's going on here and just looking at the actual sequence of events 
it's very encouraging I don't think again that we have any reason to worry about these kinds of 
experiences have been around forever, pretty much since when we started recording history 
and very likely before that. So, I don't buy into the fear narrative that our governments 
or secret governments are putting forth that this is something we should fear. I don't think that's 
the case at all. And I can tell you that the vast majority of contactees also feel the same way. 
Certainly not all of them. But I think if ETSs were truly our enemies, we would know it by now. 
So there you go. You can make up your own minds about all of this. I am simply reporting the 
facts as we know them. So I truly appreciate you guys tuning in and watching. I absolutely 
appreciate your support as well. So thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, 
keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the answers. Most important of all, 
keep having fun. I'll see you next time on another episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. Signing off.
