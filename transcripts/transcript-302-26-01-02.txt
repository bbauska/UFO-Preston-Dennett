UFO CRASH RETRIEVALS: Ten Stories of Crashed UFOs, Alien Bodies &amp; Reverse Engineering ET Craft
Jan 2, 2026

Summary:
Jan 2, 2026 (1:07:45)
It is perhaps the single most controversial aspect of UFO research. At first, researchers refused 
to even consider the possibility that such things could even happen. Today, UFO crashes are 
considered the cutting edge of UFO research. Cases like these are more common than most people 
know. In fact, there are hundreds of accounts. If true, UFO crash/retrieval cases represent the 
best possible evidence there is: the actual craft and alien bodies. This video presents ten little 
known cases, ten pieces of the puzzle towards ending the UFO coverup.

HE WASN’T SUPPOSED TO SEE. In 1946, ten-year-old Tex Martin was invited by his father to join him 
at his place of employment at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. Wandering around, Tex came across an 
open door to a hangar and couldn’t believe his eyes. There was a UFO and several alien bodies lying 
on the floor. He called his father to view them too. Soon both would regret having seen what they saw.

EYEWITNESS TO A UFO CRASH. In early July 1947, a welder stationed at Walker AFB (soon to be renamed 
Roswell) was called to an aircraft crash in the desert. He was taken to a saucer-shaped craft that 
had come down in the desert. It had no openings. It was his job to blow-torch an opening. He obeyed 
and created an opening. Looking inside, he saw three dead alien bodies in purple jumpsuits.

OF INTERPLANETARY NATURE. In August 1952, a teletype secretary at an unnamed air base in Ohio went 
to the photo lab and was surprised to see the technician developing several pictures of flying 
saucers. The technician said he had taken the photos himself after being taken to the actual crash 
site. The secret soon learned that the craft were believed to be of interplanetary in origin.

THE MATTYDALE INCIDENT. In 1954, a couple were driving through Mattydale New York when they came 
upon a group of police cars. Looking out into the nearby field, they saw a classic flying saucer 
with multicolored lights sitting out in the field. They drove off and later called police and 
newspapers, who told them it was a military secret and not to talk about it.

I COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING. In the summer of 1953, “HJ” was a private in B Company at Camp 
Polk, Louisiana when he and his fellow officers saw an egg-shaped UFO come in for a crash landing. 
Ordered to guard it, an emergency team arrived. He saw three short beings exit the craft. One had to 
be carried out by stretcher. He later learned they were taken to an isolation ward where they passed 
away.

NOBODY WILL BELIEVE YOU. 1980s. NEW MEXICO. In the 1980s, Jonathan, a flight commander Trainee had 
the opportunity to speak with a retired CIA agent who began to share startling information that the 
US Air Force has recovered crashed UFO and alien bodies. He said that scientists learned to reverse-
engineer the craft and were flying them over New Mexico Highways.

RETURN TO SENDER. In the late 1980s, Diane Tai (a contactee) and her husband were shocked when a 
package arrived in the mail by mistake. The package turned out to hold copies of letters between a 
colonel and Senator Barry Goldwater talking about UFOs and aliens being held in captivity. The 
letters made it clear that our government knows far more about this subject than they have publicly 
revealed.

THE WHISTLEBLOWER In the 1980s, a civilian subcontractor who worked at Edwards Air Force Base in 
California was walking by a hangar when he heard a low thrumming noise. Turning, he saw a small 
silver craft, a flying saucer, suspended in the hangar. His employer refused to discuss it, until 
many years later, finally revealing that it was in fact a human-piloted craft using ET technology.

THEY DEFINITELY DID NOT LOOK HUMAN. In 1986, a 14-year-old boy and his fellow civil air patrol 
members were taking a tour of the Air Force Museum at Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio, when their 
guide, an airman first class, took them into a private hangar and showed them what appeared to 
be alien bodies being kept preserved in glass tubes behind a thick glass wall. No other information 
was shared, and to this day, he wonders what he saw.

A SECRET BASE IN ALASKA. Sometime in the 1990s a high school student received an almost perfect 
score on the SATs. This caught the attention of the US government who hired him to work at a secret 
underground base in Alaska. The witness says that the base worked in three main areas: biological 
warfare, advanced sensing devices, and the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology.

These 10 cases are just the tip of the iceberg. It's becoming undeniable that our governments have 
UFOs and alien bodies in their possession. Sadly none of this evidence is in the public arena, and 
the entire subject relies solely on anecdotal eyewitness testimony. Despite this, there are too many 
cases to dismiss. And if even one is true, it’s a game-changer and has the potential to revolutionize 
the way all humanity views the UFO subject.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of 
UFOs in the Paranormal. Today I'm going to be talking about something a little different, 
which is UFO Crashes. The title of today's episode is UFO Crash Retrievals: 10 stories 
of crashed UFOs, alien bodies, and the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial craft. I think 
this subject is really important. It's not only one of the most interesting aspects of eupfology, 
it really represents the cutting edge of research here. I think it has the greatest potential to 
really change the way we all think about this subject. It's absolutely conclusive evidence of 
what we're dealing with here. All bets are off if we truly do have crashed UFOs and alien bodies. 

And I think we do because there are so many cases. It's certainly not just the Roswell UFO crash 
in 1947 in New Mexico or the Aztec crash or the Paradise Valley crash or any of a halfozen really 
well-known cases. The fact is there are literally hundreds of these reports. Many researchers have 
these cases. It's far more common than most people realize. But again, this represents the best 
possible evidence there is. Ironically, it relies solely on anecdotal evidence because none of this 
actual hardware, these ET bodies are in the public arena. So, it's incredibly frustrating. But the 
fact is, there are way too many cases to dismiss. Whistleblowers are now coming out of the woodwork.

There are so many cases of people reporting crashed UFOs, ET bodies being held in captivity, 
reverse engineering of ET technology that it's clear something very profound is going on here. 
But it's very hard to put all together. It's like this crazy insane jigsaw puzzle with thousands of 
pieces that don't quite fit together. But that's why I'm doing this research. That's why I've put 
together this episode to provide a glimpse into this amazing aspect of UFO research. So, 
I've got 10 cases for you today, 10 little known cases you probably haven't heard before, 
which I hope provide a little bit of clarity into what's going on here. 

So, let's just get started. And the first case I'd like to talk about today, I call he wasn't supposed 
to see. This occurred in June in 1946 in Dayton, Ohio. And this case was investigated by professional 
researchers. So, it's definitely got some real credibility behind it, but it's such an unusual case 
and it's not well known and certainly deserves to be. This case comes from David Dobs of Mufon Amateur 
Radio Net who referred it to Leonard Stringfield, again the world's leading expert on reports of UFO 
crash retrievals. Leonard Stringfield calls this case quote of special interest because it relates to 
an alleged pre-Roswell crash and retrieval. This case was first published in 1991 in Stringfield's 
status report 6 and later in his book UFO Crash Retrievals. The first hand witness is a gentleman 
by the name of Tex Martin. It was June of 1946 and he was only 10 years old. School had just 
ended and as a reward for doing very well in school, his father, Jack Martin, allowed Tex 
to accompany him to his work at Wright Field, the famous Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where his 
father worked installing aircraft instruments. 

So Tex joined his father over a period of days. 
And one day they both noticed an unusually large number of military vehicles and soldiers 
in front of a particular military hanger where the employees ate lunch. This was a very large hanger 
and the canteen was on one side with a large panel door which separated it from the main area. But 
on that day, Tex entered the hanger and he saw the large sliding door being closed. And before it was 
fully closed, he glimpsed a lowboy truck loaded with objects covered with tarpolins. Of course, 
he didn't think too much of it at first, but then he ate his first Eskimo pie, and being thirsty 
afterwards, he walked over to a soda pop machine, which just happened to be located by the sliding 
door, separating the canteen from the rest of the hanger. 

There was a janitor there guarding the 
walkthrough door in this sliding panel door, and the janitor offered to buy him a drink. And while 
standing there, Tex was able to peer through this walkthrough door, which had been left open, and 
he was absolutely shocked at what he saw. So, I'll just quote Leonard Stringfield here, says Leonard. 
Inside the main hanger, soldiers were working and quite a crowd was gathering. Several small bodies. 
text believes there were three or four lay stretchers in front of a large dome-shaped 
object supported on tripodal legs. Blankets were scattered about on the floor and soldiers were 
folding up a large tarpollen. He remembers that the bodies were small, brownish in color and had 
large pear-shaped heads. He estimates that the domed object in the background was about 18 to 
20 ft in diameter, was off-white in color, had no sharp points, and was encircled by a flat 
band. 

So, at this point, Tex alerted his father who came over, and he also peered through the 
open door and saw this object and the bodies. Tex continued to observe the goings on when suddenly a 
colonel noticed him and ordered his father, Jack, to take him home. Now, here's where it gets even 
more interesting because it was one or two weeks later that Jack Martin returned home with very bad 
news. As Leonard Stringfield says, Jack Martin lost his job. He told Tex and his mother that 
he had seen stuff he wasn't supposed to see. Tex remembers his father crying in the kitchen and 
the difficulty he had finding other work. Tex overheard his grandfather who also worked at 
Wright Field telling his parents that a portion of a space vehicle had been brought in. So Jack 
Martin later revealed that there was in fact an underground facility there containing top secret 
stuff that only people with the highest clearances could get in. 

And Tex Martin finally years later 
revealed his story of what he saw in this hanger at right field. Leonard Stringfield is certainly 
the pioneer when it comes to researching UFO crash retrieval cases. So when he starts talking about 
these kinds of incidents, I think we really do have to take him seriously. He's done more 
work on this aspect of eupfology than just about anybody else. And you can see from this case in 
particular how seriously our government does take these accounts and the risk that whistleblowers 
go through when they reveal these stories. This is no joke. The cover up is absolutely 
demonstrably real and it's something that we have to fight against. I think we all deserve to know 
the truth and these cases again are so important. 

So let's move to the next case. This one has not, 
as far as I know, been officially investigated. It's really virtually unpublicized. Almost nobody 
knows about it. But I think it's an important firsthand eyewitness testimony of a witness who 
looks like he was right on the scenes of this amazing UFO crash retrieval. So, I call this 
one eyewitness to a UFO crash. This occurred in July 1947 in New Mexico right around the time of 
the Roswell UFO crash. This might be the Roswell crash itself. It might be another one because it's 
my understanding that there were a few at that time. But I think this is an interesting testimony 
that definitely adds to our knowledge of what's going on here. This report comes from a retired 
engineer who way back in 1969 had joined the staff of the new University of Santa Cruz in California. 
I'll call him William. That is a pseudonym. During that year, there were several reports in 
the mountains behind the campus of UFOs that had been reported to the university, and the engineer 
had been asked to interview three of the witnesses and file an official report. 

So, William agreed, 
but he soon learned to regret his decision. This was a pretty small campus at that time, especially 
in the science department that he was a part of, and he quickly earned the unwanted reputation of 
being somebody interested in this fringe subject of eupfology. But as word of his interest spread, 
he began to receive information from other people who had very interesting stories to tell. 
And one day in 1970, a good friend of his from church, a maintenance worker, he had a friend who 
was a welder who had this amazing story to share. The maintenance worker and his friend had met in a 
German P camp during World War II. Following the war and their release from this camp, 
they remained very good friends. And in 1947, his friend, whom I'll call Thomas, again a pseudonym, 
was employed at the Roswell Air Force Base. At that time it was called Walker Air Force Base, 
but his main duties included welding jigs and fixtures for servicing aircraft. 

Now before revealing his testimony, Thomas said that he would only talk if William agreed not to 
take any notes or use any recorder. Their mutual friend, the maintenance worker, had to reassure Thomas that 
William would not betray him. Thomas said that much of the information about Roswell that was 
circulating was not true. That he wanted the truth to be revealed, but only on the condition that it 
not be revealed until he passed on. Says William, he asked that I keep secret what he told me until 
after his death, which I have done. He and my friend both passed away in the late 1980s. Now, 
per Thomas, the main witness, everyone at the Walker base, knew about UFOs because every once in 
a while they would be seen flying over the base, often in pairs. They were described as circular, 
flat on the bottom with a dome on top, and flew in perfect silence. Everyone there called them quote 
flats. Now, at the time, Thomas assumed that they were some sort of secret technology that 
had been obtained from the Germans. 

On July 5th, he had returned back to the base after 
the Independence Day holiday. Suddenly, a truck pulled up to his station and an officer got out 
and ordered him to load a cutting torch and fresh tanks for a job out in the desert. Thomas obeyed, 
and off they went out into the New Mexico desert. It was a very long drive, and by the time they 
arrived at their destination, it was already mid afternoon. Thomas was told it was a crash site, 
so he assumed that a plane had gone down. At the site, he did see soldiers down on their hands and 
knees picking up every piece of wreckage and depositing them in cloth bags of the kind that 
were used for sandbags and then placing these full bags in the back of a flatbed truck. So, 
these were just little pieces of metal that he saw them picking up. They drove further beyond this, 
out of sight from that wreckage, and came upon a second group of people standing around what 
appeared to be an intact classic flying disc. 

The craft was lying on the ground. The brush was 
knocked down next to the craft, making it obvious that this craft had skidded across the ground and 
came to a rest in sort of a natural burm. The backside of the craft was slightly lifted off 
the ground. And I'll just let William describe in his own words what he was told directly by 
the firsthand witness Thomas says William. He described the craft as being about 25 to 26 ft 
in diameter with a large dome on top. He said the craft was quote the color of weak tea with 
a kind of burnished finish. He said that there were no signs of weld marks, no seams or rivets, 
that all the edges had either an inside or outside radius. There were no visible windows or openings, 
and that's why he was brought there. 

He was told to cut an opening in the dome wide enough for a 
man to crawl through. By this time, it was getting to be late afternoon and soldiers were setting up 
a bank of portable lights. And he said that he began cutting a hole from the base of the dome. 
This is still William talking. He said it was a tough alloy and slow cutting, but the material 
was surprisingly thin. He tried bending the metal out of his way as he was cutting, but the metal 
would spring back to its original shape without creasing. He finished his cut and set the metal 
piece aside and looked into the cockpit for a few seconds before he was ordered off the craft. So 
that's Williams testimony of what Thomas told him and was clear to Thomas that the craft was 
very unusual. 

But after his brief glimpse inside it and seeing what he saw, he didn't realize just 
how unusual it was. He no longer thought this was a secret military craft. After what he saw 
inside the craft, he knew it was extraterrestrial. Again, here's William quoting what he learned from 
Thomas, says William. He said it was difficult to see very far into the craft because of the glare 
from the portable lights and the cockpit was full of smoke from the cutting torch. 
He said he saw two beings who appeared to be dead. He said the cockpit had a strong smell of ammonia. 
He described the two beings as being about 4 feet tall, but they were doubled up, so it was hard to 
say. They were wearing what he said were skin tight purplish flight suits that reminded him of 
sequins. He described their heads as what we now refer to as grays. He said there were no visible 
instruments that he could see. He was ordered off the craft with his gear and returned to the base. 
He said it was dark when they arrived. 

So Thomas became even more convinced of the extraterrestrial 
origin of the craft given what happened next back at the base. As William says, he was escorted by 
armed guards into a building for a debriefing. He said that there were several highranking officers 
at the table along with four or five civilians in suits. He said that after he was debriefed, 
he was told that he was not to talk about what he had seen as it was a state secret and if he 
was caught divulging anything, he would spend the rest of his life in prison or worse. He was 
scared to death by the threat and my friend and myself are the only people he ever told. And that 
was 23 years after the event. Now, William, the researcher, says he later tried sharing 
this interview with a few investigators, but received a lukewarm reception. Finally, in 2016, 
he filed a report with Muon, writing, "When I heard this story, I did not know what to think. 

I was not a UFO buff and had never heard of the Roswell story. My friend, the maintenance worker, 
said this guy was the real thing." And during the interview, I never sensed anything odd about his 
presentation or with his mannerisms. He provided a lot more information than I have stated. But the 
interview was almost 50 years ago. I think he was telling the truth. My friend was a very honorable 
and trustworthy man who would not knowingly support a bogus story. I never saw or spoke with 
the welder again after that evening. Certainly an interesting case. Some of the details do seem to 
contradict what other people are saying about the Roswell UFO crash, but that's one of the problems 
with these reports. That's certainly not unusual in UFO reports in general or frankly in any field 
of investigation in any subject. 

Not everyone's testimony is going to match up perfectly. And 
when they do, that can sometimes point towards collusion. So, I think this is an important case 
and certainly the people who gave the testimony believe that uh it was real. So, yeah, it's just 
one more piece of this crazy jigsaw puzzle that we're trying to put together and figure out what's 
going on. Now, here is another case. This was researched by uh eupfologists. I think it's a 
very interesting case. It comes from James Mosley who's pretty skeptical of many UFO reports. So, 
I think that's important. Anyway, I call this one of interplanetary nature. This one occurred 
in August of 1952 at an unnamed air base in Ohio. But it's a really fascinating firshand case of a 
witness who saw something that was apparently supposed to be covered up. But to her credit, 
she leaked it out and shared her story. 

This case comes from the iconic and definitely controversial 
UFO researcher again, Mr. James Mosley, perhaps best known for his somewhat skeptical publication 
Saucer Smear. This case was published in his book UFO crash secrets at Wright Patterson Air Force 
Base. James Mosley was one of the early pioneering figures of eupfology. Also really famous for his 
unfiltered exposees of various UFO hoaxes. And when reports of UFO crashes began to circulate, 
he had quote little faith in the accounts. But there was one particular account that caught his 
eye regarding a woman who worked for an unnamed large military base in Ohio. Not Wright Patterson. 

Another one. He heard a recording of this woman's testimony made by another researcher. And curious, 
he was later able to track her down for a first hand interview. In the summer of 1952, 
this witness was a civilian employee of the Signal Corps working under the Army and the FBI. 
She had a high security clearance and worked as quote a night girl on the teletype. Her duties 
included decoding messages and handling classified materials of many sorts. As James Mosley says, 
she only agreed to an interview upon the condition of anonymity. So James Mosley calls her quote Mrs. 
Y. And I'll just quote Mrs. Y directly from James Mosley's interview. 

As Mrs. Y says, "In August or September of 1952, I walked into the photographic lab to get an aspirin 
from Redacted." James Mosley calls this man Mr. Z. He's an army photographer. But again, as Miss 
Weiss says, "I walked into the photographic lab to get an aspirin from this man who was in charge 
of this section. This lab was in the same section of the communication building on the base which 
I worked in. When I walked in, he was developing a number of prints, and I couldn't help noticing 
that about a dozen of them looked like the newspaper drawings I had seen of flying saucers. 

At first, he expressed some concern that I had seen the photos. He thought he had had the door locked, 
but had gone to the restroom and forgotten to relock it. Knowing that I had a clearance, 
and being a good friend of mine, he apparently decided to relieve my curiosity". So, Mr. Z. This 
technician said that he had taken the photographs personally when he was on an assignment north 
of the unnamed base where a flying saucer had crashed. He told her that scientists employed 
by the government had a lot of trouble getting into the craft and that it was composed of one or 
more metallic alloys that were not found on Earth. And he refused to say anything else and warned her 
that the photographs were classified and carried a top security designation. As Mrs. Y says, "At that 
time, I thought this was more or less a routine photographic record of experimental military 
aircraft which frequently were tested at the base and thought little more of it until I handled 
some startling messages.

The first communications involved information that the aircraft, which was 
thought to be of interplanetary nature, was being brought first to our base under very heavy guard, 
where it would receive a preliminary examination and then be trucked to right field. Further 
messages ordered a red and white alert for the base since it was feared that the crashed saucer 
had communicated with other similar craft still flying. This made me very nervous for it sounded 
to me as if the base commander believed that other machines might attack in an effort to recover the 
disabled craft. So here Mrs. Y describes the photographs she saw of this craft in detail. 
As she says, I'm not good at this, but I would say the saucer was 30 ft in diameter. In a couple or 
three of the pictures, there was a jeep parked by it, and this gave a good frame of reference. 

It would be 40 ft at the most, I would say. It had no protrusions other than a rim where the upper 
and lower halves of the machine met. It appeared to be made of pieces of metal riveted together, 
though I couldn't see any rivets, only the different sections. It didn't have any windows 
that I could see. Some of the messages, however, mentioned that it had windows or port holes of 
one-way glass, which you couldn't see through from the outside. So, per Mrs. Why? The craft 
had no alien bodies in it, but was apparently remote controlled. It didn't crash so much, but 
floated gently to the ground due to quote, "lack of magnetic power on which they run." 

Now, she had heard rumors at the base of alien bodies in other craft, but apparently not in this one. James 
Mosley writes that he was quote greatly convinced of her sincerity. But to verify her story, he 
asked if she could put him in touch with this army photographer, Mr. Z. Mrs. Y was very hesitant, but 
finally relented and told James that he wouldn't be cooperative as he was still on active duty 
and almost ready for retirement. Nevertheless, James Mosley says he did in fact speak directly 
with Mr. Z, who verified that Mrs. why did in fact work the location, but he summarily denied 
ever photographing one or having any firstirhand knowledge of them. And he said that no saucer had 
ever passed through the base. He did describe Mrs. Why as quote an upstanding woman, and he said that 
he couldn't guess why she would be telling such a story. 

James Mosley was, of course, frustrated. He couldn't imagine a less likely hoaxer than Mrs. Y. But 
at the same time, here was Mr. Z denying the whole story. And as James said, somebody was lying. 
If Mrs. Y were lying, there wasn't anything to the captured saucer. And if Mrs. Y were not lying, 
somebody should be able 
to prove it, and somebody should tell the public. If Mrs. Y were not lying, Mr. Z would have to lie. 
What could I do about it? Not much, for I probably exaggerated my own effectiveness. But there was 
one way I could raise a lot of hell in the field and probably get a lot of public awareness going. 
The next day I would start my own flying saucer magazine. And he did. And this is how he became a 
very influential figure in this field. And that's how he started his famous magazine, Saucer Smear.
 
I found that witness to be particularly credible. She had nothing to gain from coming forward and 
sharing this. did so very reluctantly and only on the condition of absolute anonymity. And I 
have to wonder how many other people out there don't have the courage and strength to share 
what they saw and were basically told not to talk about. I would imagine it's in the many thousands, 
tens of thousands or more because it appears that this is again not nearly as uncommon as we have 
been led to believe. 

Now, let's move to the next case. Of all the 10 cases I'm presenting in this 
compilation, this one is probably the best known. It was researched by Raymond Fowler, 
an absolutely impeccable and thorough researcher who I respect immensely. I call this one the 
Mattydale incident. This occurred in 1953 or 1954, thereabouts, of course, in Mattydale, New York. 
This is a really fascinating case with I think very credible witnesses. Again, this case comes 
from Raymond Fowler, best known perhaps for his investigation into Betty Andreas and also the 
Alagash main case. He also helped break the story of the Kingman UFO crash in Arizona. But this next 
case involves a husband and wife who apparently came upon a UFO crash incident back in the 1950s. 
It was covered in Raymond Fowler's book, Case Book of a UFO Investigator. The witnesses are 
Bill Marsden, who held a law degree from the University of Brelau in Germany, had a degree 
in physics and was the director of information services at a major electronics company. And 
his wife, who also had a law degree from the same university and had served in the German army. 

So, I'll just quote Bill Marsden directly from Raymond Fowler's interview. As Bill says, 
"Aaround 3:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning, my wife and I were driving home from visiting some 
friends. We hadn't been drinking. As I crossed the freeway towards Hancockfield Airport uphill, 
I noticed flashing red lights at the intersection. There appeared to be at least four or five police 
cars. I thought there had been an accident and slowed down to avoid trouble, but I couldn't see 
any accident. After turning left into Mattydale, I looked over my right shoulder and saw an object 
that appeared to be 20 ft in diameter and possibly 15 ft high in the center. Phosphorescent lights of 
various colors were spaced across its surface. The lights from these sources were strong enough 
to illuminate several men walking around the object and examining it. Some were in uniform, 
others were not. One of them was carrying what appeared to be a large press camera on a strap 
and was taking photographs. My wife remarked that it must be the Canadian Avro disc she had 
read about. 

So, they continued on their way home and after returning home, Bill could not stop 
thinking about what they had seen. So he decided to do some investigating. As Bill Marsden says, 
"On Monday morning, I couldn't find any news reports about it." So I called the city editor. 
He said he didn't know anything about it, but would send someone to the sheriff's office to 
find out. I decided to call the sheriff myself and described the scene to the officer, who answered, 
"Yes, we know about it, but it's a military secret and we can't discuss it." I hung up 
and called the editor. When I told him what the police officer had said, he was very interested 
and said he would look into it right away. 

On my way home from work, I deliberately drove through 
the area to examine the field. The brush was freshly trampled around a shallow gully. The 
walls of this gully were compacted in two places where the object had apparently come to rest. Tire 
tracks indicated that a vehicle had entered the area from one road and exited onto the other. So 
yeah, Bill did his investigation and learned that authorities did know about this. So after talking 
with Raymond Fowler, Raymond Fowler also did an investigation, talked to police in the area, 
and they gave him various explanations. They told him stories about weather balloons falling in the 
area, about a winged tank falling from a plane and/or an airplane crashing in the woods. And 
this was all in the general time frame and area of the Marsden's sighting. So he contacted Bill 
Marsden again to ask about this. But Bill Marsden vehemently discounted each of these explanations. 

As Raymond Fowler says, both the police and the Air Force at Hancock Field told the city editor 
that no such incident had occurred. The sheriff also denied that anyone in his department had told 
Mr. Marsden that the incident was a military secret. Not wanting to be considered crazy, 
Mr. Marsden dropped the whole matter. After my investigation, I contacted Mr. Marsden again. 
Having just restudied his report in detail, I was impressed with his practical description 
of the event. I then suggested that he might have seen a balloon, a wing tank, or a bomb 
reflecting the flashing lights of the patrol car. He simply replied that this theory did not explain 
why the object he and his wife had seen was much higher than the men surrounding it. 

Furthermore, he noted that the craft, which carried individual multicolored lights, was shaped like 
an inverted bowl over another bowl, and there was a clearly defined rim where the edges of the 
B-shaped segments met. A huge thanks to those two witnesses for coming forth and sharing what they 
saw. It's really an amazing case and it looks like again this was pretty effectively covered up. 
Thanks also to Mr. Raymond Fowler for doing his very thorough research into these cases. 
It's not the only case of a UFO crash retrieval that he's uncovered. And again, I think quite a 
few researchers do run across these kinds of cases. I've run across a few myself as we'll 
see in just a few moments. But yeah, amazing. 

Now, let's move to the next case. This is another 
one from Leonard Stringfield. God bless him. We would not be where we are today without Leonard 
Stringfield. I call this next case I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This occurred sometime 
in the summer of 1953 at Camp Pulk, Louisiana. This is technically a single witness case, 
though there were many, many people on the scene who saw this. Apparently, none have come 
forward at this point. And after you hear this account and see what happened to this witness, 
you'll probably understand why this subject still continues to be controversial and has not gone 
mainstream and that there are still people who are skeptical about it. Because those whistleblowers 
who come forward almost always receive some kind of repercussion from going forward. 

This case was referred to Leonard Stringfield by Lois Cukick of the Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research and 
was also investigated by Dr. Peter Rank, who worked closely with Leonard Stringfield. The 
witness is understandably anonymous and is known only by his initials HJ. He served in 
the 24th Infantry in Korea, something that Leonard Springfield was able to verify. At age 17, he was 
a private in B company at Camp Pulk in Louisiana, serving under the commander of Sergeant RS, 
again whose name is known by Leonard Stringfield. This case was published in Leonard Stringfield's 
status report 3 and later in his book UFO Crash Retrievals. It was around dusk one evening in 
the summer of 1953 that HJ was on maneuvers with his platoon of about eight or nine men when they 
observed an unidentified egg-shaped object make a crash landing on the soft sandy soil. They said it 
was as wide as a three-bedroom singlestory ranch house. Pretty big. They immediately 
notified their superiors and HJ and his fellow soldiers in B company were ordered to guard 
the site while a special detachment and other emergency vehicles were rushed to the scene. HJ 
learned that the site was roped off for a 50mile radius and MPs were posted on guard everywhere. 
HJ says that he was able to initially approach within 45 ft of this strange object before later 
being ordered by a lieutenant W to pull back to 300 ft away, said HJ. Peons like me had to get 
out of the way. Nevertheless, he did get a good look at this object. And I'll just quote Leonard 
Stringfield. As Leonard says, according to HJ, the large ovoid object was without windows or lights 
and was surrounded by a fin-like protrusion at its equator, which was still rotating. The 
ground around it, he said, was burnt into a powdery substance like crushed brick and was 
still hot. Soon to arrive at the site were top brass and medics. He remembered them going to the 
hatch on the side of the craft which was open and after a while watched as two medics carried away 
a stretcher containing a body to the ambulance and then three other of the crew emerging being aided 
by the medics as though injured. The occupants of the craft were only 3 and 1 half to four feet 
tall, a very slight build and walked as though they had no knees, very stiff, bending only at 
the hips. The large heads also without features he believed were covered by a helmet. Their uniform, 
tight fitting, he described as a dull metallic green. Her h when the hatch opened, there was 
a small ramp which the surviving UFO occupants used to walk out of the craft. One of the UFO 
occupants was two injured and yes, was carried on a litter by ambulance personnel. But per HJ, 
one of the UFO occupants who was walking, quote, kept looking at the one in the litter and made 
strange noises. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Now, HJ later heard that the survivors 
of this craft had been taken to a hospital and put in isolation, but that all three had soon died and 
their cadaavvers were sent to a medical center near Washington, DC. Following this incident, HJ 
and every single person involved in this retrieval operation were subjected to quote every kind of 
test. This happened over a period of 3 days at the base hospital. Now, although reluctant to talk 
about his experience, HJ did cooperate with Lois Qick, Leonard Stringfield, and Dr. Rank, allowing 
them to interview him repeatedly. But he stressed over and over again that he wanted to be anonymous 
and wanted no publicity whatsoever. It was during one of these interviews that HJ said that he had 
finally located a list of all the members of the B company who had also been involved in this 
operation and actually sent this list to Dr. Peter Rank who sent the list to Stringfield. Leonard 
Stringfield then personally asked HJ to write a signed statement testifying to his experience. And 
this is what Leonard Stringfield says happened. Says Leonard. He consented, wrote three pages, 
and signed his name. His wife mailed the letter at the local post office on October 3rd or 4th in 
1981. It never arrived. On February 3rd, 1982, I called HJ to inquire about his health and to 
advise him to send another statement by registered mail. His phone had been disconnected. Wow, what 
a case that was. This witness was clearly very profoundly affected by it. And my heart goes out 
to all the people who experience this firsthand and are basically told, "No, you can't talk about 
it." And they don't talk about it. And when they do, we see what happens. It's such a shame. This 
UFO Karov has got to stop. Secrecy is the wrong decision. I can understand that there are some 
things that we don't need to know. But something this profound, this earth shaking, I think we all 
deserve to know the truth. And this is the kind of evidence that is absolutely, as I said earlier, 
conclusive to the point that it would change the way everybody on earth feels about this subject. 
So yeah, we deserve to know the truth. There are so many cases. Here's another one. This is 
one that I researched personally. I call this one Nobody will believe you. This occurred in 1980s in 
New Mexico. This was published in my book, Not From here, Volume 1. It is technically hearsay 
in that I did not talk directly to the witness involved, but I did talk to somebody who did talk 
to the witness, and I think you'll find this story particularly compelling. This case comes from a 
man named Jonathan who I interviewed personally. He contacted me after reading about my research 
into UFOs. He said he was at one time employed by the United States Air Force. He worked as a 
flight commander trainee at Aniston Air Force Base in Alabama. One evening in late 1976 while walking 
the base grounds with a friend. He says they encountered a metallic disc with yellow lights 
around the perimeter. Jonathan and his friend both experienced a period of missing time and 
this left them absolutely convinced that UFOs were real. But he never thought that the subject would 
cross his path again. Later, after leaving the military, Jonathan was told a strange story by a 
man I'll call Bill. Bill is the brother-in-law of Jonathan's exgirlfriend. Now, per Jonathan, Bill 
was employed by the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency. Jonathan believed him because he noticed 
that every winter Bill would disappear for the season and when the cold was over, Bill would 
reappear with a deep dark tan and some strange tropical disease that he had contracted from 
some exotic unknown country. At the time Jonathan knew Bill, Bill was a retired CIA agent, if there 
is such a thing as Jonathan pointed out, and he was currently employed as a private detective. 
One day, the subject of UFOs came up, and Bill told Jonathan what he had found out while working 
for the CIA. Bill said that he knew firsthand that the Air Force had in its possession a crashed UFO 
and that alien bodies had been collected by the military where they were being studied. 
Bill told Jonathan that the aliens were pretty much humanlike, that their organs were different, 
their heart was located in a different place in their body, the blood pressure was off the scale, 
and other strange abnormalities. Bill further states that he knew that one of the aliens was 
kept alive for a period of time, though all the others died when the UFO crashed. But that was 
just the beginning because Bill then stated that the government was not only holding a number of 
crashed UFOs, but that they were actually flying them around. Bill said that they would fly above 
the interstate highways in New Mexico late at night and would go from base to base. This was 
apparently a regular practice, one which resulted in an inevitable accident because according to 
Bill, these UFOs were being manned by military personnel. And one night, a militaryowned UFO 
crashed directly on an interstate highway in New Mexico. Bill said that the entire highway was 
completely cordoned off around the crash site and the highway was closed down because it was 
impossible to keep the event entirely secret. The media and the public were misinformed that 
it was simply the crash of an advanced military aircraft, which I guess it was, but the UFO and 
all traces of it were quickly recovered. Now, Jonathan, the gentleman I talked to, was quite 
taken aback by Bill's story and said, "This is dangerous information. Why are you telling 
me this?" And Bill told him, "It doesn't matter because nobody will believe you anyway." And then 
made an insinuation that those who knew too much mysteriously disappeared. So, needless to say, 
Jonathan was shocked by all this. And because of his previous encounter, he was certain that 
UFOs were real, but he had no idea that UFOs had crashed and been recovered. And he wasn't sure 
he was happy knowing about this. When I spoke to him, he asked me if I had heard anything like this 
before and was quite surprised that I had. He kept saying, "Really? Really?" as I related similar 
stories to him like the Roswell UFO crash. It was obvious to me that he thought UFO crashes were 
unheard of. Admittedly, that's just a tiny glimpse into what's going on here. Very hard to verify, 
but these stories start adding up. If it were just one or two or 10 or 20 or even a hundred, 
well, that would be one thing. But it's now in the hundreds and mounting towards the thousands, 
if not there already. So, no one's really been able to put all these cases together into one 
database. That I think would be a research project well worth doing. Leonard Stringfield certainly 
gave it a try, but he's just one researcher and he's now passed on. And there are researchers who 
focus on this solely. And I think it's time that yeah, these reports are taken far more 
seriously than they are because it's such great potential for pager for really getting the proof 
that we all deserve that UFOs are real, which I think we already know by this point. But yeah, 
these cases are so amazing. Now, let's move to another case. I've said several times already that 
many researchers have these kinds of cases. Well, here's one from another researcher, Dr. Edith 
Fiori, PhD, who wrote the first book uh about UFO encounters by a person who has a PhD. So, 
her research, I think, is profoundly important and has had a huge effect on this field. I call this 
case return to sender. It occurred sometime in the early 1980s in Northern California. And again, 
this is just a little tidbit, a little hidden jewel in the huge number of cases, but definitely 
worth knowing. This next account was published again in Edith Fury, PhD's book, Encounters. that 
occurred in the late 1980s when she interviewed a UFO contactee by the name of Diane Tai. Dian's 
and her husband Paul by pure chance received compelling evidence that our own governments 
have obtained crashed UFOs and alien bodies. So I'll just quote Diane directly. As Diane Tai says, 
"One day about four or five years ago, Paul came home and he was shaken. He said, "I want to 
show you something that came into the company by mistake. It was addressed to a different company. 
Technical something. His is technical analysis." We opened it up and it was letters from an Air 
Force colonel to Barry Goldwater and some other people. And there were letters back and forth 
about how this colonel had seen UFOs. He knew of other Air Force people who had seen UFOs. And 
why wasn't some of this information out? And what was going on at some Air Force base in California 
where they had a UFO and alien bodies? This was in all those letters. There were all these different 
letters back and forth and copies of letters. Paul said, "I'm really scared about this. I 
don't know what I should do." Now Diane herself being a contactee was very much intrigued and 
actually thought it was wonderful. She was very excited about it. She said that there were about 
seven letters total. Senator Barry Goldwater was mentioned repeatedly and the letter showed that he 
knew all about the issue of UFOs, crashed saucers, and alien bodies in captivity. Paul, however, 
was not as excited. He was deeply concerned and didn't want to get involved. And as Diane says, 
he took the letters and I never saw them again. He said he got rid of them. Paul told Diane that 
he had found the address to the company that the letters were supposed to go to and he mailed them 
there. What's so interesting about this case is that Senator Goldwater is well known for 
having been very vocal about the UFO issue. In fact, he's quoted as saying, "I've been flying 
now for 44 years, and I'm the last guy that's going to say I don't believe they're up there. 
I've never seen one, but when Air Force pilots, Navy pilots, airline pilots tell me that they 
see something come up on their wing that wasn't an airplane, I have to believe them. I am indeed 
interested in unidentified flying objects. I frankly feel that there is a great deal to 
this and I have discussed it often with many Air Force officers. So, several investigators have 
done research into the Barry Goldwater connection. Timothy Good is one of them and he writes about 
this in his book Above Top Secret. As Timothy Good writes, Senator Barry Goldwater, former chairman 
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, visited Wright Patterson hoping to get permission from 
General Curtis Lame to examine the UFO evidence stored there, but he was refused. Copies of 
letter from Goldwater to various researchers in my files are worth quoting here. In a letter to 
Schlommo Arnan on 28th March 1975, he wrote, "The subject of UFOs is one that has interested me for 
some long time. About 10 or 12 years ago, I made an effort to find out what was in the building 
at Wright Patterson Air Force Base where the information is stored that has been collected by 
the Air Force and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above top secret. 
I have however heard that there is a plan underway to release some if not all of this material in 
the near future. I am just as anxious to see this material as you are and I hope we will not have to 
wait much longer. On April 11, 1979, Goldwater wrote to Lee Graham, "It is true I was denied 
access to a facility at Wright Patterson. Because I never got in, I can't tell you what was inside." 
We both know about the rumors. The room that the senator tried to visit is called the blue room. 
And according to my information, it contains UFO artifacts, but not craft or bodies. In 
another letter to Lee Graham dated 19 October 1981, Goldwater wrote, "First, let me tell you, 
I have long ago given up acquiring access to the so-called blue room at Wright Patterson is I have 
had one long string of denials from chief after chief. So, I have given up. In answer to your 
questions, one is essentially correct. I don't know of anyone who has access to the blue room, 
nor am I aware of its contents, and I am not aware of anything having been relocated. To tell you the 
truth, Mr. Graham, this thing has gotten so highly classified, even though I will admit that there 
is a lot of it that has been released, it is just impossible to get anything on it. Now, it's such a 
shame that Peter Tai didn't make copies of these letters he had accidentally received because it 
would certainly be nice to know who this unnamed colonel was, but there can be no denying that 
Senator Barry Goldwater was absolutely convinced that there was something to these stories of UFO 
crash retrievalss and alien bodies and ET tech being held in secret by our governments and 
our military. So amazing. Senator Barry Goldwater really fought hard to get some of this information 
released and failed. He was unable to do it. Many researchers have looked into his involvement with 
the UFO subject. There's zero doubt that he was very interested in this and took it incredibly 
seriously. And he's just one of many government officials who have worked hard to get the truth 
out. So kudos to Senator Barry Goldwater for doing what he could. But again, this coverup is no joke. 
It goes beyond the highest levels of government to the military-industrial complex to a cabal if you 
want to use those words. I think the cover up, the folks behind it are really the intelligence 
agencies, uh the Pentagon, the military-industrial complex, the highest levels of the military. 
So, we we've got quite a job ahead of us to try to get the truth out about what's going on 
here. But I don't think we should give up because again, this is such important information. So, now 
let's move to another case. This one also comes from myself. Of all the people I've interviewed, 
I think this gentleman really provided a one of the most profound stories in terms of 
whistleblower accounts. It's very rare that I've gotten whistleblower accounts, only a handful, 
but this is probably one of the best. I call it the whistleblower. This occurred sometime in the 
1980s. The location is Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California. I did publish this account 
in my book, Wondrous, and I briefly mentioned it in my episode called The Invasion of Edwards 
Air Force Base, but here I want to tell the whole story because it deserves to be well known. This 
case comes firsthand from a man I'll call Vernon Spencer. That is a pseudonym. But as he says, "My 
job for over 20 years was to provide specialized construction equipment to the California high 
desert, including Edwards Air Force Base, China Lake, and Lockheed Helenale, among others. My 
customers were primarily tied to government contracts and prepared bids. An equipment rental 
budget was one of the clauses that had little restriction. Our company began to apply 100% of 
the rental paid on the construction equipment to go to the purchase. To make our profit, we tacked 
on the usual 10% on new purchases. So, in other words, what Vernon is saying is that customers 
at Edwards Air Force Base used a shortcut to get equipment quickly, bypassing the more official 
route of submitting a formal request that would need budget approval and unwanted red tape. And 
because of this, Vernon was granted special access to the base with one particular incident in the 
late 1980s at Edwards Air Force Base that left him badly shaken. As he says, "I was called to Edwards 
by a longtime customer because what they needed did not currently exist in the design required. 
I was given an annual base security sticker, good for every base in my territory." So Vernon put 
the sticker on his unmarked company vehicle and he drove to the Jet Propulsion Lab on the east 
side of the base. As he says, "I was then driven to a building at the top of Rocket Site Mountain 
and then handed off to my customer. During our walk to his office, I ended up behind him. While 
passing by a structure in the building, the hair on my head and arms tingled, and a thrming could 
be heard and sensed. There was a partially open viewport that my curiosity demanded me to open. 
Vernon turned his head and looked inside, and he could barely believe his eyes. As he says, 
"I witnessed a craft hovering in a chamber only attached to what looked like instrument cables. 
It looked like one of today's streamlined midsized cars, like a Honda Accord. My customer grabbed me. 
He kept jamming his index finger against his lips so I would not make a sound. Our meeting 
concluded without any mention of what I saw. So Vernon finished the job and left the base, 
but he often thought about what he had seen, but had no opportunities to investigate it. 
But one year later, the same employer showed up at Vernon's company looking to 
rehire him. As Vernon says, while he was at our facility, we got into a joking pissing contest, 
and I said I would no longer provide him with a thing until he told me what I saw. So, 
they had a few beers together and were talking about this, and it took some convincing, but 
Vernon finally got the answer to what he saw that day at Edwards Air Force Base. As Vernon says, I 
took him to lunch and he said it was from a failed Star Wars program that was supposedly scrapped but 
became a black project. Counterrotating magnetic fields were directed in a way that caused a hole 
or void to be projected in the desired direction of travel. He mentioned Tesla Tech and said that 
there were dozens of these drones in use. It was 30 years later in very bad health with his wife 
gone and no kids that Vernon felt compelled to share his story. As he told me, I'm an old 
guy here. Why not try to enhance the disclosure process? My heart goes out to this man. I mean, 
he contacted me on his deathbed in a hospital and died shortly after he spoke with me. He wanted to 
do his part to end UFO secrecy and kept this story secret for most of his life as he was ordered or 
basically threatened to do. This information has to come out. I I keep saying it. We all deserve 
to know the truth about what's going on here. Now, let's move to another case. So many of 
them. I call this next one they definitely did not look human. This occurred on August 31st in 1986, 
apparently at Wright Patterson Air Force Base to a teenage witness who was taken to see what appear 
to be ET bodies. Now, this case was has not been officially investigated. It's virtually unknown, 
but this witness did provide firsthand testimony, so I think we should at least take a look at it. 
It took the witness 37 years in this case to report his experience which occurred when he 
was only 14 years old. At the time he had joined a civil air patrol auxiliary of the US Air Force 
out of Circleville, Ohio. They would do surgeent rescue operations out of Pickleway County and also 
drill ceremonies in marching competitions and other things. In 1986, the witness, 
who I'll call Craig, that is a pseudonym, says that he was taken with his group to visit the 
Air Force Museum at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Was after the trip that a young airman, 
first class, took them for a ride in a military passenger van to give them a closer look at the 
base itself and some of the aircraft. And it was during this time that the airman asked the group, 
"Would you like to see something neat?" The group of course unanimously replied in the affirmative 
and this led to an experience that Craig would never forget. As Craig says in his own words, "So 
our group was taken to a building which I can only describe as a combination warehouse and aircraft 
hanger. We were taken through a side door. It was dark inside. The airman hurried us all in, shut 
the door, and turned the light on. They were the kind of lights that are in a gymnasium that have 
to warm up. And we could see across from where we were a large wall, partially metal, mainly 
metal at the bottom, and what appeared to be very thick, possibly bulletproof glass. But you could 
see that there was something in there. The airman flipped on a few more switches, and lights came 
on inside that shielded area. Now, we could see five or six tubes, what look like tubes, leaning 
in a 45° angle against the wall from the barrier. And a few more switches go on and there appears 
to be bodies of some kind in these tubes. They definitely did not look human. So all the kids 
were understandably shocked and really weren't sure what to think. As Craig says, I remember 
we all kind of looked at each other thinking this can't be real. You know, it was a kind of 
disbelief. We all heard rumors about bodies being brought back to Dayton. The couple of the bodies 
seemed absolutely normal other than they were lifeless apparently. and a couple seem to have 
been in some kind of crash. They seemed mangled and damaged and also deceased. There has been some 
disbelief over the years myself, thinking this has to be some kind of showpiece they're going to put 
in the museum as a gag. But all these years later, it's never been in the museum. So, I wonder what 
I really saw that day all those years ago. I can't help but think I saw deceased aliens being kept in 
some kind of tube, almost like a cryogenic tube or something to preserve the body. Though apparently 
nobody asked any questions at the time, everyone just stared at the bodies in stunned silence, 
wondering were these real ETs or something else. Finally, the tour came to a sudden close. 
As Craig says, after what seemed like a long time, but I know it wasn't, the airman kind of realized 
we got to get out of here and you guys have to leave. We were shuttled back outside. All the 
lights went back off and we were put into the van and drove back to our adult chaperones who 
are waiting for us. I think you'll agree that's an interesting account. You have to wonder what's 
going on here. Why was he and these other children taken to see these ET bodies if that's what they 
were? Uh there's quite a few accounts like this where people are basically taken to see something 
that nobody else gets to see. Almost as if it's a test run to see how the public would react to 
disclosure. So perhaps that's what was going on here. Hard to say for sure, but it's certainly an 
event that this witness remembers decades later, as most of these witnesses do. That's another 
thing that's interesting about these whistleblower accounts. These are not people who are being taken 
on board a craft and undergoing procedures or meeting ETSs face to face or that's recalled under 
regressive hypnosis or anything like this. These are not distant sightings of anomalous lights at 
night. These are people who have had very close encounters with what appear to be crashed UFOs, 
ET bodies, reverse engineering of ET craft. It's amazing to think all of this is going 
on right under our noses and the general public has no idea. So now let's move to the last and 
final case in this compilation. I call this one a secret base in Alaska. This occurred sometime in 
the 1990s as near as I can tell uh in Alaska. Uh this case actually was researched by me. I 
have to thank my father for actually getting me the information about this case. He played 
an integral role in that even though oddly he was profoundly skeptical of UFOs. Uh he absolutely was 
supported my research even though he never really did read my UFO books. Uh he definitely helped me 
quite a bit. His account was published in my book Not from Here Volume One. I've never talked about 
it in any of my episodes. So, I think it's time to reveal this particular case. Again, I have to 
thank my father, James Dennett, for bringing this story to light. This case involves two people, 
neither of whom would give the real names. So, I'll call the first person Greg Edwards, 
and the second, the main witness, Tom Matthews. My father spoke to someone who knew Greg. So, 
this story was passed to me through two intermediaries. As the main witness, Tom, 
refused to speak to me directly. Greg and Tom were apparently best buddies and considered each other 
blood brothers. Greg thought he knew everything there was to know about Tom. But then one day, Tom 
approached Greg with a startling revelation. Tom said that nearly everything he had told Greg about 
his life was not true. That he had lied about his job, where he worked, what he did, everything. All 
of it was lies. Tom then told Greg the truth, what he really did for a living. And what Tom 
revealed about his work is the stuff of science fiction, but Tom insisted that it was all true. 
Tom's story began in high school. He was extremely intelligent and had received an exceptionally high 
score on the SAT, the Scholactic Aptitude Test, and in fact, his scores were so high, it caused 
some attention to be paid to him. It seemed that the United States government was very interested 
in Tom and wanted him to work for them. He had no idea then what his high scores were going to 
cost him. Government officials first approached Tom's parents and asked them if they would allow 
their son to work for the government. When Tom's parents gave their consent, Tom was approached 
and given an offer he basically could not refuse. In exchange for his services, he would receive a 
top secret clearance to match a ridiculously large salary. and his job was to conduct research in a 
top secret underground facility in Alaska. So Tom accepted the offer and went directly out of high 
school and into government service. He had to tell everyone that he was stationed in Nevada, but this 
was only a cover story because in reality, Tom spent only his weekends in Nevada. On weekdays, 
he flew by private military jet to this top secret government base in Alaska. The base, 
he said, was an eight-story building located almost entirely underground. The base itself, 
this is interesting, was financed by setting up the world's leading drug smugglers. This is what 
Tom was told. Officials would arrest the drug smugglers, confiscate all the money and drugs, 
and turn around and sell the drugs back to another smuggler whom they would then proceed to arrest 
and confiscate. This may sound like a strange way to finance a scientific military research base, 
but it's obviously very profitable and although perhaps not strictly legal, 
such practices were done in the name of national security. Tom reported that the base was mainly 
a research station that nabbed up some of the best scientific minds in the country and had the 
latest technology for advanced research. He said that there were three major areas of research of 
which he was aware. First, the base researched and developed biological weapons, which, as Tom said, 
made all other weapons look like child's play. Secondly, the base researched and developed 
electronic sensory and detection devices that apparently allowed telescopic sight through 
solid objects such as walls and ceilings. Thirdly, and most importantly here, the base researched and 
developed electromagnetic propulsion devices, flying craft, which needed no fuel to operate 
other than the Earth's magnetic field. According to Tom, the ships looked just like UFOs, were able 
to hover silently, and move at astonishing speeds. And as Tom said in his own words, 
"Some of the UFOs seen over Alaska are probably ours." Now, Tom refused to say exactly what 
his own job at the base entailed, but he did say that the security was extremely high. Every week, 
he was subjected to a horrible ritual. Due to the nature of his job, everything about him had to be 
known. He would be taken to a special room where he was given a dose of sodium pentathl truth serum 
and put into a hypnotic trance. For a period of a couple of hours, he would be interrogated into 
every single aspect of his life for the past week. Every detail would be laid bare to make 
sure that there were no security leaks. This agonizing ritual was repeated every week for 
as long as he was at the base, and there were no exceptions. Tom finally got out of the business 
after several years because he said the lifestyle was just too harsh. Since he left the base, he has 
been and still is under very close monitoring by the government. After his release from the base, 
he was offered several extremely high-paying jobs by some of the country's leading corporations. 
Tom declined these offers and pursued a more modest job and lifestyle. And that's Tom's story, 
which alone again could be easily dismissed. But in addition with those collected by the other 
researchers, it seems evident that our government is in possession of UFOs and in fact are flying 
them around. Again, that case was published in my book, Not From Here, Volume 1. It's a five 
volume series, soon to be six volumes, which I explore all different aspects of eupfology. So, 
you can check that out if you'd like. What's really interesting is Timothy Good, one of my 
favorite researchers, actually read this account and published it briefly in one of his books. So, 
he is also an amazing researcher who is working hard to end the UFO coverup. I think that's one of 
the reasons most researchers are out there trying to get this information out. Uh, the UFO coverup, 
I think, is a real bad choice. Our governments, our secret governments have badly bungled the 
whole UFO situation. The coverup should never have taken place. It's interesting because when the 
Roswell crash happened in 1947, there was that memo, that press release which basically said, 
"We have a UFO." And then it was retracted. If it hadn't been retracted, we might be living 
in a very different world. such a shame because again judging from the huge number of accounts 
there's no doubt in my mind that these UFO crash retrievalss have taken place that there's a ton of 
them and that to some extent we have reverse engineered ET technology to the point that a 
lot of what people are seeing particularly these days is in fact not extraterrestrial 
in terms of the ETSs being inside but us humans flying this stuff around. So that alone makes 
this kind of research of absolute importance. So thank you very much. I hope you've enjoyed 
this episode. I truly appreciate you guys watching and and until next time, 
keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most important of all, keep 
having fun. I will see you next week for a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. Bye for now.
