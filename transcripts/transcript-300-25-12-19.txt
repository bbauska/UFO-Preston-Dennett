Only a person who has had a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid can truly know what it’s like. Words such as “shocking,” “scary,” or “bizarre,” only hint at the powerful impact such an experience can have. This video presents ten firsthand cases of human encounters coming from all over the world. Cases like these have much to teach us about these strange visitors to our planet, and about ourselves and our relationship to the ETs.

I WAS NEVER AFRAID. On the morning of August 8, 1968, two men began a thousand-mile drive from Seattle, Washington to Los Angeles, California. As night arrived, they noticed an odd light pacing their vehicle. Soon there was another, and then a third. Suddenly, the third object dropped down in front of their car and a half-dozen humanoids looked down at them. It was a face-to-face encounter that would leave them both shaken.

THE ALIEN CHAUFFEUR. On the night of November 8, 1971, a schoolteacher waited at a bus-stop outside of Turku, Finland, when a car stopped in front of her and a man offered her a ride. She accepted and was amazed to see that the man wore a shiny silver jumpsuit and emitted a strange forcefield around him. The car took off in silence and seemed to float over the road, which was now strangely devoid of traffic. By the end of the trip, the teacher was convinced the man was not human.

I WAS SHOCKED. On the night of December 6, 1978, Pilar Martinez de Arregui was shocked to see a strange craft land in the fields of her farmhouse in Alegria, Spain. Looking out the window, she saw two men in jumpsuits approaching her home. She fled to the bedroom, but still curious, she returned to the window just in time to see the craft taking off. Later, strange landing impressions were found in her field.

THE HAIRY GRAY ALIEN. One day in 1989, a ten-year-old boy took a walk with his dog in the forests behind his home in rural Wisconsin. Suddenly his dog stopped and stared ahead. Looking up, the boy was amazed to see a strange being with large dark eyes, brownish skin and white-blond hair staring back at him. After a short stand-off, the boy and his dog ran away. Later, he saw pictures of other grays and realized he had seen an alien.

I FROZE DEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCREAM. Peter was just a little boy when he woke up one night in March 1994 in his home in Middletown, New Jersey to see two aliens floating around in his backyard. One floated right up to his window and stared at him face-to-face. The boy turned to run and found himself frozen in place. After the event, he totally forgot what happened, and only recalled it years later in a bizarre way.

I WAS SHOCKED BEYOND BELIEF. On the night of July 27, 2008, a couple woke up in their home in Columbus, Ohio, to see the ceiling swirling with strange lights. Suddenly one of them noticed a humanoid face in a beam of light. He turned to his partner, who could not see the face. Moments later, more than a dozen grays appeared in the room. Still, his partner was unable to see them.

THE SCARIEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. Hearing about a man who claimed to be able to call down UFOs, a 14-year-old from Leesport, Pennsylvania decided to try doing the same thing. On November 24, 2004, he mentally asked for an encounter. Hours later, there was a UFO sighting near his home. That night he was woken up by ETs in his room. Soon the ETs would be back and he had a dream memory of being taken onboard. 

WE ARE STILL AFRAID. On May 5, 2014, while driving along the I-77 in Charlotte, North Carolina, a mother and daughter were amazed to see a UFO appear in front of the car. As they drove, the craft seemed to follow them. Turning the car around to videotape it, the craft swooped down in front of them. As they began to drive off, a humanoid appeared by their car. Later, they realized that they had an hour of missing time.

THE ALIEN IN MY CLOSET. On the night of May 1, 2016, a man from South Dakota was awakened in his bedroom by a strange sound. Looking at his closet, he saw a three-fingered gray alien peering out at him. The man found himself paralyzed and in direct telepathic rapport with the alien. He finally managed to break free from the paralysis and the alien promptly disappeared back into the closet and was gone.

THERE WAS SOMETHING INSIDE IT. On the night of July 17, 2018, a couple drove up to their home in southern Illinois and saw a brilliant orange object in the sky. It released a smaller light which dropped into the forest behind their home. Moments later, they were confronted by a giant cigar-shaped craft and through the portholes of the craft, they saw humanoids looking down at them.

Ten humanoid cases, each adding another piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. While there are still many questions surrounding this subject, the huge number of cases points to the idea that we are being visited by what appears to be extraterrestrials from another planet.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennit and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and 
the Paranormal. Going to be talking about humanoids today. Love these humanoid cases. 
I find them endlessly fascinating and I think they provide really incontrovertible evidence 
that we are not alone in this universe. Do think we're dealing with extraterrestrials here. I call 
this episode the scariest night of my life. 10 truly bizarre encounters with extraterrestrial 
humanoids. I've got 10 cases for you today from all over the world dating from 1968 to 2018. Two 
from outside of the United States and eight from inside the United States including Finland, Spain, 
California, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. 
We have different types of ETs, some multiple witness cases, some evidence to support these 
cases such as landing traces and physiological effects and animal reactions and so forth. 
But mostly these cases to me are interesting because they're not well known and they contain 
unique details of high strangeness. Really bizarre details that I think have something 
to offer in terms of helping us to understand what's going on here. So let's just get started 
with our first case which I call I was never afraid. This occurred on August 8, 1968 mostly 
in series California. Well, this is an interesting case because this took place on a lonely highway 
late at night. That is absolutely a category of encounters. Quite a few cases take place that way, 
which seems to me opportunistic in terms of the ETSs just see someone driving down the highway 
late at night and decide, let's contact these guys. This is also a very longlasting encounter, 
which I find quite interesting. And there are some other really interesting details in this 
case. 40 years passed before the witness Colin, that is a pseudonym, found the courage to report 
his encounter with a UFO and its occupants. He was actually watching an episode of the History 
Channels UFO Hunters in 2008, which finally inspired him to come forward. was back in August 
of 1968 that Colin and his friend Jack Cole, that is his friend's real name, decided to leave their 
homes in Los Angeles, California for a week-l long trip to Seattle, Washington. And it was on 
the return trip from Seattle back to LA that their lives changed forever. Around 800 am on August 8, 
1968, they left South Seattle and began the 1100 plus mile trip back to Los Angeles. This would 
normally take them a minimum of about 18 hours, so they did not expect to arrive before 2 or 3 
a.m. They filled the gas tank up in Sacramento and continued south on Interstate 99. and they 
were about 12 hours into the trip and had traveled some 800 miles and were approaching the city of 
Stockton. This point Jack was driving and he started to complain of an unusual feeling of 
pressure in his lower neck. They passed through Stockton and were near the town of Series, 
California when they first noticed a strange light in the sky ahead of him. And as Colin says, 
I saw this light straight ahead, but a little high to be ground level. It was kind of bright, but it 
didn't look like it was moving, so I thought it was a TV tower or something like that. About 2 
minutes later, it started to move up and off to my upper right. About this time, I felt the pressure 
from my lower back side of my neck, like something was trying to push me forward with pretty good 
force. So now they're both feeling this strange pressure. And as they traveled through series, 
they lost sight of the strange light. But just as they were exiting the outskirts of series, 
Jack started shouting and pointing out the driver's side window at a strange object covered 
with lights. And as Colin says, just across the other side of the freeway and just above the 
lights from series was a banked oval ring of blue black lights. With the windows rolled down, there 
wasn't a sound. was going the same speed as us, exactly the same. It was then that I got such a 
strong feeling that they could hear and understand us. So, at this point, Colin turned to his friend 
Jack and said, "It might sound nuts, but I'm going to ask them if they can hear us and understand 
us." So, speaking out loud, Colin asked, "Can you hear us? Can you understand us?" Jack immediately 
started yelling as the ship appeared to obviously respond to Colin's questions. As Colin says, 
I looked over and saw it blink out its lights, and you could see it give us an answer by showing 
us the bottom side. It was diamond shaped with lights pulsating. There was a cluster of different 
colored lights in the center and several at each corner. It stayed that way for a few minutes. Then 
it gently went back to the ring of blue black lights, still going the same speed as us. Now, 
it was around this time that Colin looked out the right side window, and was amazed to see a second 
object about the same distance away as the first, not far away. Colin also noticed something else 
strange. Suddenly, there was no traffic on the freeway. And it was just a few moments later that 
a third ship appeared. As Colin says, suddenly there was a third ship down in front of us above 
the highway about 30 to 40 feet. It was about a half block away, but we could see that it was lit 
up inside with a soft glow. There was a panel in the background middle of the ship. It had a lot of 
lights that changed patterns. There were about seven to eight figures standing in the windows 
looking at us. They moved around a little, but not very much. They really seemed intent on us. Now, 
Jack was so shocked by the sight that even though he was in the fast lane of the freeway, he brought 
their car to a full stop. At this point, the two crafts on either side also stopped, and the craft 
in front of them remained still. Colin and Jack stared at the humanoids for a few minutes, while 
the humanoids stared intently back at them. Then remembering that they were still in the fast lane, 
Colin suggested that they either start moving or get off the highway. And as Colin says, Jack 
started the car and all three crafts began moving right along with us again. Now, at that moment, 
a big semi-truck zoomed by them. The trucker waved at them, seemingly oblivious to the three strange 
craft still hovering nearby. That really puzzled Colin. So they pulled off the freeway to view the 
craft more closely. As Colin says, he did get off, but I think he was scared. But I was totally okay. 
I never felt afraid. So back on the freeway we went and then with us. Then one by one they zipped 
off into the night sky and then blinked off. So the men continued the drive home. They did notice 
that the area where the craft had left was right on the outskirts of Castle Air Force Base, which 
could be significant. They ended up arriving home around 2:00 a.m., which really surprised them as 
normally this trip would have taken a bit longer than that. But most shocking was that looking at 
the gas gauge, they saw that they still had a third tank of gas. They thought this was pretty 
unusual and that it was too much gas for the El Camino car, which didn't get grace gas mileage. 
They also learned that there have been a number of UFO sightings in the Seattle area on the morning 
that they had left. So, there were a few other really unusual details. Says that there were some 
other weird events on that day which he did not include in his report. But as he says, even though 
it happened a long time ago, it's still fresh in my mind. A pretty fascinating case that lasted a 
real long time. It's interesting that the witness felt that there was more gas left in the tank than 
there should be and that they got home earlier than they should have. Though, I have to say, 
I did sort of analyze the timing of this and it is possible that they made it home at that time, but 
they would know better than I. So this could be a case of added time as opposed to missing time. 
And there are quite a few cases like this. It's also an interesting aspect that these gentleman 
was able to sort of interact with the UFO. He felt like it was reading his mind and asked it to react 
and it did. So that is also a fascinating aspect to this case that turns up in quite a few cases. 
Probably the most interesting and unusual detail for me was that both witnesses described feeling 
a pressure on their body. I've heard this a few times. People will be in the presence of 
a UFO and they can actually feel it sort of as a pressure on their body. I don't know exactly 
what's going on in this case, but I feel like it's probably some sort of force field perhaps 
or something intentional. Hard to say. These cases always leave more questions than answers, 
but I think it's an important case. So, now let's move to the next one. And I have to say, 
I have never heard one like this. I think this truly fits the definition of bizarre. I call 
this one the alien chauffeur. This one occurred on November 8, 1971 outside of Turu, Finland. 
And the witness is a teacher, a good witness, but yeah, such an unusual case. This remarkable 
case comes from Finnish researcher Murvy Vertan. The witness is an anonymous 37year-old teacher. 
I'll call her Olivia. That is a pseudonym. Was a cold, rainy night at 8:45 p.m. on November 8, 
1971. As Olivia stood at a bus stop outside of Turu, Finland, she was waiting for the bus 
to take her home after work and she had only been there for a few minutes when a dark car stopped in 
front of her. The driver was a humanlooking man and he asked her where she was going. So Olivia 
replied that she was going about 20 km towards Turu where she lived and the man offered to give 
her a ride to the bus stop in her hometown. Noticing that it was raining, Olivia decided 
to accept the offer and stepped into the car and they drove off. But it was then that Olivia began 
to notice several very strange details. The first thing she noticed was that she sensed some kind of 
invisible magnetic or electric field between the driver and herself. and looking at the driver who 
was staring ahead at the road. So, she could only see him in profile, she saw that he had a slender 
body and seemed elegant in a strange way that she couldn't fully describe. But most astonishing were 
his clothes. He was wearing this very unusual silver gray outfit. It was too dark for her to 
see it in much detail, but it definitely looked unusual, and more strange details soon emerged. 
The man began to speak to her, asking her all kinds of questions about her job as a teacher, 
about her students, and he seemed to be strangely unfamiliar with normal school life. The next 
strange thing she noticed was that the car was absolutely silent. No engine sounds, no thrming of 
the tires on this pavement, and in fact, the car itself looked to her like it was floating about 
3 to 6 ft above the surface of the road. So, this really puzzled her. And yet another strange thing 
was that the road, which was normally pretty busy, had no other traffic. No cars in front or behind 
and no cars passing in the opposite direction. So puzzled, Olivia looked outside and could see the 
familiar landmarks passing by along the roadside, but yeah, no other cars. Wasn't long after this 
that they arrived at the bus stop in her hometown. Olivia asked to be let off. The driver, however, 
said that he wanted to continue the conversation. Olivia told him that she had to leave because she 
had her children waiting for her at home, and the driver then asked if they could continue the 
conversation another time. Olivia refused, saying that her husband wouldn't understand. The driver 
asked where her husband was. Olivia told him that he was in Sweden on business and that she had to 
hurry home to care for her children. So, she was clearly getting a little nervous about all of 
this. And this is when she told the man goodbye and he also replied goodbye. And at this point, 
the car door opened by itself, she said. She immediately stepped out. The car moved forward 
and it disappeared from view. did not disappear off into the distance as the road was straight 
for at least a kilometer ahead of her. The car just s suddenly disappeared into thin air. So, 
that's another unusual detail. And there were more because immediately after the encounter, 
she suffered from strange hot flashes. Later, she had other strange symptoms, including a severe 
headache, a reened face, and static electricity on her body. I did a whole prior episode on 
cases which people picked up what appear to be extraterrestrial hitchhikers. So that case is sort 
of the tables turned. This lady was picked up by what appears to be an ET. Now while she didn't see 
any UFO, I think there's enough strange details to say that this is something really unusual. I mean, 
one or two strange details would be one thing, but she describes not only this weird force field 
coming off of this person, that he looked strange. He's wearing this silver jumpsuit. The car is not 
making any noise. It looks like it's floating off the ground. And these strange details really 
start to add up. The ET is asking all these weird questions. Ultimately, when she's dropped off, 
she watches this car disappear. So that and the fact that there was no traffic on the road. These 
are all details that add up to, I think, show that this was a very unusual encounter, probably with 
an extraterrestrial, but you can make up your own mind about it. So now let's move to the next case, 
which I call I was shocked. This one occurred on December 6th, 1978 in Allegria de Alava in Spain. 
In most respects, I think this is a typical case, but it's really interesting because it's not well 
known. This lady had a UFO land in her backyard and got a very closeup look at ETSs. And I think 
what's interesting about that is that there's really no room for misperception here. This 
unusual case comes from Spanish researcher and author Jose Nice Gua. He investigated the case 
personally, actually traveling to the location and interviewing the witness firsthand. The witness is 
Parinez de Argui. Was 40 minutes after midnight on December 6th, 1978. Par was in her home located in 
the small village of Allegria. This is about 11 kilometers from Vtoria in Alava, Spain. 
She had just eaten dinner with her husband after a long day's work. Her husband went to bed while 
she cleaned up. She was opening the windows of their farmhouse when she noticed a powerful orange 
light coming from the field outside. And as Par says, "At first I thought it was just a tractor, 
but then I realized it was like butane, very strong, like a fire, and I was somewhat shocked." 
So she's describing this really unusual bright fiery orange light. It faded slowly and then 
disappeared from sight. So composure, she started to clear the table where they had just finished 
eating. And this is when there was a second flash of light, but much closer this time. This really 
caught her attention. So looking outside, she saw this completely spherical object moving at very 
high speed directly towards their farmhouse. She was gripped with fear and she quickly ran to the 
light switch and flicked it off, plunging the room into darkness and hopefully hiding her from view. 
Looking back outside, she saw that this object had now landed in their field almost right next 
to their farmhouse, no more than 100 m from the window, 300 ft. and she watched in panic as two 
very tall humanoid figures suddenly appeared next to the UFO. They did not seem to exit 
through any doorway. They just appeared next to it. They were both dressed in very light colored, 
tight-fitting one-piece coveralls, and each was carrying an object like a flashlight as they 
slowly approached the house. Now, Pilar wondered for a moment if they could be vandals intent 
on setting fire to their farm fields, but they clearly weren't normal people, as she could now 
see this craft clearly, which was ovoid shaped and was gently swaying, apparently not fully landed, 
but hovering just a short distance above the ground. So, she hid behind the window blinds, 
still watching them approach. But as they got closer, she became afraid. So, she fled to the 
bathroom and then to the bedroom. Still uneasy about what was happening, she finally got up and 
returned to the window for another look. And she got there just in time to see that this strange 
craft was now rising up from the ground, emitting a faint metallic sound, which she said was similar 
to that made by a quote coffee grinder. Again, researcher Joseé Luis Guiera visited the spot 10 
days after the incident occurred. And looking at the location where this strange craft had 
apparently landed, he did find strange marks on the ground. So there you go. A fairly typical 
case of a UFO landing and humanoids. In this case, these were humanlooking ETSs, presumably 
ETSs. Though I think it is possible that this was a human piloted craft reverse engineered. But that 
raises the question is why would they be landing next to some old woman's farmhouse and walking 
right up to it? It's really odd. But an important case, I think because it did leave landing traces 
which were verified by a UFO researcher. So when there is physical evidence, I think that raises 
the credibility of a case, but certainly one, it's a case that I think deserves to be better 
known. So now let's move to the next case. This is one of my favorite in this compilation because 
it's so unusual. There are many different types of ETS, but this description is I don't want to say 
unique, but very unusual. So, I call this case the hairy gray alien. This occurred in August of 1989 
in an undisclosed forested location in Wisconsin. It is a single witness case involving a child, 
but I think it's an important observation of what appears to be a very unusual gray 
extraterrestrial. The witness in this case was only 10 years old when he had his encounter, but 
he remembers it vividly. The exact location is not listed, but it was in a rural area in the forests 
of Wisconsin. As the witness is anonymous, I will give him the pseudonym Hector. And even though 
Hector was only 10 years old, his father was a lifelong forest service worker. And this gave 
Hector a great love for nature and an excellent knowledge of wildlife in his area. And he enjoyed 
hiking through the woods. was one day in August of 1989, the exact time of day is not given, 
that Hector had an encounter that would affect him for the rest of his life. As Hector says, I 
was walking on trails behind my rural home. While walking, my dog suddenly stopped dead and began 
growling into the woods. I looked into the woods and saw an entity about 25 ft away, motionless, 
standing against a tree. was completely silent and completely still. Appearance-wise, it looked 
like a traditional gray alien, about 4t tall with a spindly frame and long arms and legs. It had 
huge black almond-shaped eyes and just small slits for nostrils and a mouth. However, what 
I saw was definitely not gray. Its body and face were brown as it deeply tanned, and it had hair, 
long white blonde hair on its head, just like a human would. So, for the next 5 or 10 seconds, 
Hector stared in shock at this alien, and the alien stared back right at him, still completely 
silent and motionless. But then it started to move in a very peculiar way. As Hector says, 
the creature began to sway from side to side. The wind suddenly switched and began to blow harder, 
and that's when I ran. I ran to my house in a panic. My parents were both home, 
and I told them what I saw. So, after hearing Hector's description, his father asked him, 
"Perhaps you saw a white-tailed deer facing you." Hector vehemingly disagreed as he says, "It 
absolutely was not." Now, to his parents' credit, they did believe he saw something. As Hector says, 
"My parents knew I'd never be that frightened and upset over nothing. So, they both ventured outside 
to the area I saw the creature and returned after seeing nothing there." After this, strangely, 
the subject was not brought up again for years. But about 32 years after the incident, Hector did 
ask his mother if she remembered what happened. And as Hector says, she told me that she did as 
she'd never seen me that scared before. 32 years later, we still remember. Now, like most people 
who've had a direct face-to-f face contact with an extraterrestrial, Hector was profoundly affected. 
And even today, the encounter still affects him. As Hector says, "Ever since, I feel a visceral 
reaction to depictions of gray aliens. They not only frighten me, they make me irrationally angry 
as well. It's such a deep feeling, I thought I would mention it. The sight of them on TV or in 
books triggers a sort of avoidance instinct in the extreme, and I need to turn the page or change the 
channel. It was 33 years after his encounter that Hector finally found the strength and courage to 
share it publicly. Such a fascinating case. There are other cases of people who describe 
grays having hair, but it certainly does not turn up a lot. It's also an interesting case because 
this witness was walking with their dog and the dog saw the ET first. They were close up enough to 
this figure, this gray, to definitely there not be any real chance of misperception. Like the parents 
said, "Oh, maybe you saw a deer." Don't think so because you can tell by how deeply impacted 
the witness was later seeing pictures of Grays and just not being able to even look at them. There is 
a possibility there's more to this encounter. When someone has that strong of an emotional reaction, 
it's kind of a red flag. Then again, maybe this was just a very close up view of a gray alien. 
It's interesting to me also how this alien s started swaying back and forth. Don't know what's 
going on there, but I would be interested to know what exactly the ET was doing uh making those kind 
of odd movements. A very interesting case. So, now let's move to the next one. This one is so 
fascinating to me. I call this one I froze dead in the middle of a screen. This occurred one evening 
in March of 1994 in Middleton, New Jersey. And this is such an interesting case for me because 
of how the witness recalled his encounter. This case comes from an anonymous gentleman, 
so I'll call him Peter. He submitted his firsthand eyewitness testimony to Muon. Sometime in 2011, 
Peter was running downstairs, something he had done many times. But this time he forgot to duck 
his head and accidentally smacked the top of his head into the ceiling. He sat down dazed 
and was recovering when suddenly he remembered a strange event that had happened when he was just a 
young boy in his childhood home in Middletown, New Jersey. Weirdly, he had completely forgotten it. 
Somehow banging his head on the ceiling brought the memory of it back. This strange event occurred 
sometime in March 1994. And as Peter says, I'm a little kid when this happens. I wake up in the 
middle of the night. It must be close to morning. The moon is full and so bright that it's casting 
a shadow of a tree that used to be there. For some reason, I starting out into the yard behind 
mine. When I did this, I saw what I thought were two orange balls floating into the yard. 
As they got closer, I could see there were people with orange kind of rounded glass helmets with 
white suits, like a space suit. They had two arms that stuck out from either side, 
and at the tips on the bottom, it would pulls out these little white rings. But as the rings 
got closer to the ground, they would grow larger, somehow creating forces that lifted them over both 
fences. They didn't travel side by side. One was 30 to 40 ft behind the first one. They went around 
the right side of my pool and floated over into my backyard. So, at this point, Peter is kneeling 
on his bed in his bedroom. His hands are on the window sill. His face is pressed up against the 
window and he's staring out in amazement at what he is seeing cuz it's now clear to him that these 
beings were not human. As Peter said, one is in my backyard and the other is going off to the right 
when I noticed that the first one was looking at me. It then floated up to my window until I was 
staring at this person in the face. Even though the color of the helmet was a very bright orange, 
I could tell that it had pale white or light colored skin. Its eyes are a little bigger than 
ours, but they are completely black. It had a small nose. I didn't notice ears. It had very 
thin lips. You could tell that it had a mouth. I am looking at the sky for a few seconds and I had 
no feeling of fear at all. I was just in awe. But as soon as it smiled at me, my heart sank. This 
is when I was going to run straight up to my mom and dad's room, screaming for mom. But Peter never 
made it cuz as he turned and screamed out, all he got out was the word ma and he became paralyzed 
and unable to speak. As Peter says, it did something to me and I froze dead in the middle of 
a screen. After that happened, my mind goes blank. So this is where Peter's memory of the event ends 
that he feels certain that this event did happen to him. The strangest part is that the memory of 
the event had completely left his mind for a full 17 years until by chance he hid his head on the 
ceiling. And this brought the memory back in vivid detail. As Peter says, I can remember very clearly 
seeing two aliens in my backyard. I never had any memory of the events before I had hit my head, 
and I have thought about it every day since it happened. That is so fascinating to me how this 
witness recalled his encounter. There's something that I call a cue. People will have missing time 
or not even remember anything until suddenly there is something in their environment that allows them 
to remember their encounter. Many people have told me that it was the cover of the book Communion by 
Whitley Strieber and just seeing that image of a gray alien that brought their memories back of an 
encounter. But it can really be anything. Seeing a light in the sky, the words UFO, 
anything that re reminds them of their encounter can bring it back out of the blue. I talked to one 
gentleman. He didn't remember anything until he was an adult. Had a childhood encounter where he 
was taken on board and having dental surgery as an adult brought his memory of his encounter back. So 
that's clearly what happened in this case, but the gentleman bumped his head. So talk about having 
your memory joged. That's literally what happened to him. So interesting. And I suspect there's 
probably more to that case than he can recall. So I if there is, I hope he comes forward and shares 
what happened. So now let's move to the next case which I call I was shocked beyond belief. This 
case is a multiple witness case, though only one saw the actual humanoids. It occurred on July 27, 
2008 in Columbus, Ohio. And I have to say, I have never heard a case quite like this. So, 
I'm glad that there is a multiple witness cuz otherwise I think the witness might have really 
questioned his sanity. So, well, let's just get to it and you can make up your own minds about it. 
This very unusual case comes from two gentlemen, a couple, one who is the primary witness. As they 
are anonymous, I have given the pseudonyms Josh and David. They are partners and live 
together in their home in Columbus, Ohio. On the night of July 27, 2008, at about 300 a.m., 
they went to bed. Josh lay awake when he noticed a very strange optical effect on the ceiling of 
their bedroom. As Josh says, I was staring at the ceiling, which I have done many times before, 
when I began to notice it looked like a snowstorm of stars. I just thought my eyes were focusing 
in the darkness when it started to intensify. The ceiling looked almost like I was traveling through 
space. So Josh first thought that there was something wrong with his eyes or his health, but 
he was only 34 years old and in excellent health. And as the weird effect became more pronounced, 
he finally told his partner David that the ceiling was looking really strange to him and to look up 
at it and did he see anything strange? David did and replied, "Yes. What is that?" Josh replied, 
"What? You can see that?" David said, "Yes." So events now suddenly escalated into high strangess. 
as Josh says. We then proceeded to lie there and watch what seemed to be a cosmic show when 
suddenly I felt something around my foot or ankle and I began to feel little pin pricks on various 
parts of my body. I began to scream and crawl up my bed. So he grabbed David and shouted, "I swear 
I just felt something touch me." As Josh says. We both began to panic and then we sort of laughed 
it off and I lay back flat on my back and began to look at the ceiling. But this time there was 
a much more intense illumination beaming from the ceiling at the foot of my bed. And as I started to 
look closer to my horror, I saw a huge face at the foot of the bed surging towards me or hovering in 
the midst of this fog or haze or illumination moving like I had never seen something move. 
Panic struck me like never before, and before I could really process what was happening, 
another green-like glowing vapor or haze appeared around the side of the bed, and to my disbelief, 
I saw about 15 or so smaller sized beings appearing in the haze. I began to scream and cry 
like a child. Mind you, I am a 34year-old man who does not just break down, sobbing in terror. Now, 
weirdly, his partner David was unable to see any of the beings, but he did see Josh's intense fear, 
and he also began to panic because of it. And as Josh says, as I wrestled to clutch for my partner 
and flit my body towards the other direction, I was struck with intense pain in my upper back on 
the right side, like something did not want me to get away. My partner leaped out in terror at what 
I was doing and flipped on the light, trying to reassure me that there was nothing in the room. 
After some moments, the experience just ended. But Josh was left badly traumatized. The figures 
he saw, he says, looked just like gray aliens. As Josh says, I don't know what all this means, 
but the faces of the smaller ones were those alien faces we have all seen many times over the years. 
I was shocked beyond belief. They appeared to be observing the bigger interdimensional one. 
I cannot get this experience out of my head. Is there anyone that can help me? Definitely 
a very unusual case and yet in many ways it fits a very common category of what we call a bedroom 
visitation. That is in fact the most common place to see is an extraterrestrial would be in your 
own bedroom. This is when most people are visited. So that definitely fits a very prominent pattern. 
Don't know what was going on with the ceiling, but that seems to me intentional perhaps to get 
the attention of the witness. I don't know. Very unusual aspect about this case is he 
describes so many of these little gray ETs in his bedroom. Usually it's one, maybe two or 
three. More than that is very unusual. So yeah, a really interesting and bizarre case for sure. 
Now, let's move to the next one, which I call the scariest night of my life. This occurred on 
November 24th, 2004 in Leport, Pennsylvania. This is a single witness case, but I like this case 
because this is a very good example of what we call a C5, a close encounter of the fifth kind or 
a human initiated encounter. The witness in this case is anonymous, so I'll just call him Allan. He 
was 14 years old when he had his encounter. It was the day before Thanksgiving, November 24, 2014. 
Allan was watching television in his family's home in Leport, Pennsylvania. A program was on 
which depicted a gentleman who claimed to be able to telepathically call down UFOs. Now Allan was 
skeptical but he was also intrigued by the idea of being able to initiate an encounter. So he decided 
to give it a try. As Alan says, "I basically asked to meet the pilots of these strange 
craft and to learn about the vehicles and how they work." He did this all telepathically, which was 
one of the reasons Allan was actually willing to attempt it because, as he says, it would save me 
the embarrassment if I give it a try. Now, to his amazement, the telepathic summoning seemed to work 
because, as Allen says, a couple of hours later, I was shocked to see a report on a separate channel, 
a news channel, that there was a UFO spotted over Reading, Pennsylvania, only minutes from where 
we lived at the time. Of course, this could have been a coincidence, but given what happened next, 
Alan does not think so, cuz Allan says, "A few hours later, in the middle of the night, the red 
capital letters, wake up," were flashed before my closed eyelids, and an alarm like a buzzing 
inside my head, an intense vibration. It woke me up immediately. I had been awakened, terrified by 
two alien beings, commonly referred to as the grays, standing in front of me, staring at me 
at my bedside. I don't know how they did it, but they had woken me up telepathically somehow. I saw 
them in front of me. The one that was closer to me was much taller than the other. I immediately 
panicked, throwing the blankets over my head and trying to calm my respiration and heart rate. 
I waited and waited for them to leave with sheer terror. The scariest night of my life. I heard 
feet rustling on the carpet. As daylight began to break, I took a cautious peak to see that they had 
left. So Alan had called out to the ETs and they had apparently responded. But his encounter with 
them wasn't quite over yet cuz it was just a few nights later that he had an unusual urge 
to watch TV late at night on a school night. and he's not even sure why, but as he says, "I suppose 
I was still shaken from a few nights prior." His stepmother normally kept the television 
remote control in a kitchen drawer, so he went in there to retrieve it, and it wasn't in the drawer, 
so he began to search the kitchen for it. And this is when he saw the aliens again. As Alan says, 
I turned around and skimmed the countertop of the kitchen island only to see the same creature from 
nights before standing outside of the kitchen window staring at me. Startled, I must have 
jumped three feet in the air and ran out of the kitchen up the steps to my bedroom. So going to 
bed that night, the high strangeness continued. Because as Alan says, "That night I had a strange 
and vivid nightmare of my blankets being lifted into the air and being dragged out of my bed by 
the ankles by the hands of two shorter grays, then being returned to my bed and watching them leave 
to a strange pink portal in the wall. So today, Alan remains convinced that he somehow initiated 
an extraterrestrial encounter. He never saw any UFO, but he did meet the aliens. As Allan writes, 
I have decided to go public about the terrifying things that have happened. That case, I think, 
is a bit of a cautionary tale. Be careful what you ask for because reaching out to ETSs can in 
fact initiate an encounter. And the very best way to do a C5 is absolutely through mentally calling 
out to them telepathically. It's all about consciousness. As many people have said, ETSs 
communicate telepathically. So if you reach out to them, sometimes they will respond. But again, 
be careful what you ask for. It's one thing to see a UFO. It's quite another to see an ET. And 
I suspect in this case he probably was taken on board and only remembered it through the dream 
state. I wish there was more details to that. But such an interesting example of a C5. So now let's 
move to the next case which I call we are still afraid. My heart goes out to these two ladies 
during such an incredible encounter. This occurred on May 5, 2014 in Charlotte, North Carolina. This 
is a very extensive case. Again, another example of people who have an encounter on a highway 
late at night. This happens so often that it definitely again does deserve its own category, 
but I think you'll find this a particularly interesting and unusual case. This very extensive 
and unusual case comes from a mother and daughter who reported their experiences to both Mufon and 
Newark about 2 weeks after it occurred. Peter Davenport of Newfor writes, "We spoke with the 
witness via telephone and she assures us that the report is sincere. The witnesses are anonymous, 
so I'll call the mother Elaine and the daughter Anna. These, of course, are pseudonyms. 
It was around 8:30 p.m. again on May 5th, 2014 as Elaine and Anna drove southbound on Interstate 77 
through Charlotte. Anna was driving and Elaine sat in the front passenger seat. And as Elaine says, 
I noticed a really bright light off to the right of us up in the sky. This huge thing was just 
floating there in the sky. Was no plane. It was silent. It did have blinking lights, but they were 
pretty insignificant compared to the huge bright white shiny string of lights that seemed to be 
in front of this thing. So, Elaine asked, "What is that?" Her daughter pointed out the blinking 
lights and said, "It was probably a plane." But Elaine wasn't convinced, and the two of them began 
to argue about what this thing might be. And they kept their eyes glued on it until they reached a 
section of the highway which had bright street lights, and this blocked their view. It was at 
that moment that something very strange happened. As Elaine says, all of a sudden, a huge round ball 
of solid bright white light came right at the windshield out of nowhere. It took up most of 
the windshield. I braced for impact, but it didn't hit the car. It just kind of seemed as though it 
evaporated into it. Anna shouted out, "What was that?" Her mother said, "You saw that? I don't 
know what that was." So, both were frightened and stunned. They could actually feel the heat of the 
light on their face and hands, and both noticed an odd pain in their stomachs following this. Anna, 
in particular, complained that she wasn't feeling well. Not long after this, they said 
a large helicopter swooped right over their car. They thought that was strange. So, Elaine ended 
up calling her husband and telling him what happened. And because Anna was feeling unwell, 
they pulled off at the Denny's restaurant in Rock Hill. I think this is the one right here. You 
can see retrieving their jackets from the trunk, they noticed something strange. Everything in the 
trunk was unusually hot, including their jackets. So, after staying at the restaurant and getting 
something to eat, they weren't very hungry. They did notice a strange time discrepancy. was 11:00 
p.m. when they thought it was only about 1000 p.m. So, they got back on Interstate 77. Elaine was 
driving and as soon as they began driving, these strange lights showed up again and actually seemed 
to come right towards their car. Anna shouted out, "It can see us. It's looking at us." Now, 
these lights now had the appearance of a line of red lights. And as Elaine says, then it flew over 
the car. By this time, it was moving very slowly and low. The whole thing turned slowly like it 
was facing our car while staying in the same spot. Strangely, there was no traffic but us. So, both 
were pretty scared and became even more so when this object appeared to change shape. So, they 
took off to get away from the object. They were still on Interstate 77, now between Rock Hills 
and Colombia. They had a video camera and wanted to capture it on video. So Elaine decided to turn 
around and head back towards this object and she calls this quote the worst decision of my life. So 
almost immediately they came upon the object and as Elaine says it was as if it was waiting for 
us. I skiitted to a stop. We were in shock. It was at tree level. We were just sitting there stunned. 
So they sat there for several minutes. Then with the object still there, they decided to 
get back on the I77 South. They pulled off at a Shell gas station to relieve themselves and then 
making a U-turn to get back on the freeway. They were shocked to see a strange entity standing by 
the guard rail. As Elaine says, we saw something standing there. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. 
was right next to the road, right next to the door of the car. It seemed to be bristling, 
like it was luminescent in some way, but it was really dark colored, like it was camouflaged. 
It moved towards the glass next to my daughter. She put her hands and arms up over her face and 
head and tucked her head downwards. That's how close it was to her door. It was dark gray green. 
I could see a larger than normal rounded top of a head that came down to a short little neck 
area and straight out to both shoulders. Human shoulders aren't shaped that way. It had very 
thin, long arms. The thing that made me realize that it wasn't human was that its waist was only 
like 8 in wide and that it was about 4t tall. I remember thinking, "It's so skinny." So Elaine 
drove off and her daughter turned to her and said, "Was that a person?" They had actually planned to 
drive home, but decided to stop to sleep in a hotel because they were so overwhelmed. And 
later reconstructing the trip, they realized the trip should have been about 1 hour and 45 minutes, 
took almost 4 hours. They do believe that they probably had missing time and were probably taken 
on board because both found a strange unexplained bump behind their right ear in the same spot. 
Anna was so frightened by all of this that she doesn't even want to talk about it. But Elaine 
feels compelled to get some answers. As Elaine says, I am submitting this report because I feel 
that people should know what my adult daughter 28 years old and I went through. We are still upset 
and still not our usual selves. I guess we are both upset and we are not sure what to do about 
it. I can't get it out of my mind. I just can't get the image of that creepy little thing out of 
my mind. Even right now, I can still see it. Every time I get the same feeling of outright 
fear. We think we are still being followed. We are still afraid. It's still very upsetting. I don't 
understand why it chose us. I'm still scared. I still can't believe that it happened at all, 
but I know it did. We know it did. Now, Elaine adds one small, but I think an important detail, 
which is so bizarre that she doesn't know how to explain it, but says it occurred while they 
were looking for a restroom after seeing the UFO and before seeing the humanoid. As Elaine says, 
I saw a black bear on the side of the road was sitting up like a ragd doll propped up. 
Its legs and arms were forward and it was sitting on its rear end. Its shoulders were leaned forward 
and its head was gone. Not chopped off, was flat where its head had been. My headlights lit it up. 
I could see a dark hairy ring, a red meaty ring, and its spine in the middle. The head was not 
there. This may or may not have anything to do with everything else that happened that night. 
I just thought I should include it. I really do feel for witnesses who go through an encounter 
like this because it's difficult to process. You can tell that they were quite traumatized. 
The daughter still doesn't want to talk about it. The mother is seeking answers. It's pretty 
clear that they were probably taken on board given that they do have this mark behind their 
ear that is a commonly reported detail in onboard encounters. though neither of them have any memory 
of it. There's also this sort of missing time aspect. Another huge red flag, but some really 
bizarre details to this case like the ET just standing there on the side of the road. To me, 
the very most bizarre aspect of this case is the mother's description of seeing a headless bear. 
I have no idea what's up with that, but clearly it is related because it's not every day you see 
a UFO and then an ET and then a headless animal just kind of sitting there in a way that's not 
at all normal. So perhaps that was a screen memory. I don't know. But I can certainly see 
why these people decided to reach out and try to get some answers. And I hope they find them. 
There's a lot of people dealing with these kinds of experiences. It's one of the main reasons I 
do this research, put out these cases, because I know a lot of you out there are experiencing 
these kinds of things and there are these rare bizarre details that turn up. So, yeah, 
I'm sure that there are other people who've experienced this exact same kind of thing, 
but most people don't report it, especially if it's got these truly bizarre and unique details. 
So, now let's move to the next case. I think this is probably my favorite in the whole bunch, 
though. That C5 one with the young kid is also really interesting. But this one, wow. I call 
this one the alien in my closet. This occurred on May 1st, 2016 in an undisclosed location in 
South Dakota. It is a single witness case. But what's interesting to me is that this gentleman 
had a very amazing interaction with this gray extraterrestrial. This very unusual and intriguing 
case comes firsthand from an anonymous witness I will call Eli. It occurred in an undisclosed 
location somewhere in South Dakota. On the evening of May 1st, 2016, Eli was asleep in bed with his 
wife when a strange noise woke him up. As Eli says, I opened my eyes facing my closet door, 
and I saw three long gray fingers slide out and slowly pull back the closet door until it 
had enough room to poke its head out and lock eyes with me. The creature had rich gray skin, 
large black almond eyes. Though I couldn't see its entire body, its face was a few feet from mine, 
much larger. One eye was about half the size of my face. The creature must have cleared 6 
and 1/2 to 7 ft. Now, Eli could also see that its forearm and hound were much longer than a humans, 
when it looked to him like it was almost hanging out of the ceiling of the closet. Seeing that it 
was an unknown preacher, he decided to take quick action. As Eli says, I immediately jumped up to 
grab my block 19 on my nightstand, but instantly realized I couldn't move. My body didn't feel 
too heavy to move or tingle. It's just that there was no connection between my brain and my limbs. 
I screamed in my head for several seconds for my wife to wake up, but was immediately caught 
by its gaze. It began smiling at me, and somehow I understood it was testing my reaction to it, 
amused at my powerlessness. Slowly but surely, I focused on my limbs, and as soon as I got my foot 
to twitch, the being irritated. It was a bottle of wills. I realized I was in control of my own 
body and started pushing through the block. It expressed its irritation by showing its teeth, 
which I wasn't aware gray beings have. The long pointed teeth were terrifying. By this point, 
I had partial control over my right arm and left leg and began pulling myself to my pistol. 
As soon as I slid my hand onto my nightstand, the being slowly pulled its head back into the closet 
and began to slide the door shut. As soon as the door clicked shut was like a switch was flipped, 
and I had full control again. I jumped out of bed, grabbed my pistol, hit the light, and flung open 
the closet door. Now Eli was ready to shoot, but the closet was now empty. The only evidence of the 
entity was a quote sweet weird chemical smell. He estimates that the entire encounter lasted 
about three minutes and he believes the purpose of the encounter was somehow to test him. As 
Eli says, it did not speak with words, but with intention. I don't believe it wanted to harm me, 
but was testing me to see how I reacted. And when violence was my reaction out of fear, 
it showed me how powerless I was. until I realized I could focus and push through its block, at 
which point it became angry and departed rapidly, leaving before I regained full control. Some super 
fascinating details to that case. In many ways, it is typical. It's your bedroom visitation with 
a gray alien. But what I find fascinating about it is that this ET came out of the closet. I can't 
tell you how many times I've interviewed people who describe this exact same thing. ET's hanging 
out in their closet and out they step and into the room. Uh what's also really fascinating about this 
case is that this gentleman had a telepathic link with this gray ET and felt that it was testing him 
and he could feel the emotions coming off of this gray. So definitely they are emotional. One detail 
that I found really telling was his description of the gray having teeth. Very, very few people ever 
describe seeing the teeth of a gray alien. And in every case that I've heard of, when they do, 
they do describe these grays having sharp teeth. So, to me, that's some level of confirmation of 
the validity of that case. But really fascinating because although it was somewhat scary for him, 
he ultimately decided that this gray did not mean him any harm and was just kind of testing 
his reaction which was what? One of fear and violence. Typical human reaction and I suppose 
perfectly understandable if you wake up and see a 7-ft tall gray with sharp teeth in your bedroom. 
So now let's move to the next case which I call there was something inside it. This occurred on 
July 17, 2018 in southern Illinois. This is a really fascinating case of a closeup UFO 
sighting with humanoids looking down at the witnesses. This case comes from Muon Field 
investigators Barry Gaunt and Bill Kidd and Illinois State Section Directors Sam Moranto. 
He published an article in the February 2019 issue of the Mufon UFO Journal. The primary witnesses 
are an anonymous couple whose names are known by Muon, but for the purposes of this presentation, 
I shall call them Steve and Sarah. Was a warm summer evening with clear skies on July 17, 
2018. As Steve and Sarah drove up to their home in southern Illinois, as they pulled into 
their driveway, Sarah, who was driving, noticed a strange light in the sky. It's a brilliant orange 
color with a intensity unlike anything she had ever seen before. So, she pointed it out to Steve 
and asked, "What's that light?" Steve didn't know, but he kept his eye on it as he exited the car. 
Sarah now occupied herself by retrieving the groceries from the car. And as Steve says, 
then it moved, which really caught my attention. But this time, I noticed a small light coming 
out of its right side. So Steve watched as this smaller light descended in a falling leaf motion, 
while the larger object veered off at a sharp angle, shrinking in size. So at this point, 
he wondered if it might actually be an airplane crash. But there was no sound. So he walked away 
from the truck around the house to get a better look at this object as it descended behind the 
trees and disappeared from view. But it was only moments later that he saw another strange dark 
object hovering among the nearby trees. As Steve says, I noticed another object maybe 500 ft from 
me. And then I froze. It was cigar or ovalshaped with no wings. was now close enough that the house 
security lights illuminated it so he could see it pretty clearly. And the object then moved even 
closer, much closer, so that Steve could now see it was a strange craft of some kind complete with 
large windows or a port hole. As Steve says, it was some 40 to 60 ft away and hovering 20 to 25 
ft off the ground. It's flat black in color. I can see red and green lights. It's maybe 60 to 
70 ft long by 15 or more feet wide and maybe 8 to 10 ft thick. Then I see shadows in a window 
in the front. I don't know what I see. A face, a shoulder, or whatever. I can't make it out. Now, 
whatever is inside the craft, it's moving around. And stooping down, Steve can now see 
that this craft is in fact metallic with a sheen and color that looks to him almost like titanium. 
He can see two red lights and one green light on the side. It said it almost appeared V-shaped. 
And now he could see that this figure inside was still moving about. It was a figure. So he became 
frightened and ran to alert his girlfriend. And as Steve says, I snap out of my shock, I guess, 
and run towards where she is walking in front of the vehicle and say, "It's a UFO." So they 
can now both see that there are definitely humanoid figures moving around inside it. 
They can see their heads, shoulders, torso, and arms. One of the figures bends forward. 
And at that moment, the bottom area of the craft lit up, and the craft moved in a quick, quote, 
almost fluid-like motion, and it rose right over a tree while making a sort of whooing sound. The 
craft then moved very quickly up into the starry sky and disappeared into the distance. They ran 
inside and immediately called the police who did not seem surprised and actually mentioned that 
there was an earlier encounter in this area. Both witnesses were pretty shaken up by the encounter. 
Steve experienced insomnia and became somewhat ill following this incident. Sarah was reluctant 
to go outside at night after this. And even their dog appeared to hesitant to go outside for a few 
days following this encounter. So there you go. a really unusual case. I suspect that that might be 
a human piloted reverse engineered craft cuz there are certain details. The human looking figures, 
the texture of the craft, the lights on it, uh the sounds it made. Hard to say for sure, but it 
does fit some of the details. And certainly, it's possible. This is something we have to 
consider in a lot of these cases that they're not ET, they're actually us. One interesting aspect 
of that makes me wonder about that, however, is the synchronicity of this craft showing up right 
when these people come home, almost as if it was waiting for them. And if this was human piloted, 
why the heck did it come swooping down and almost land and get so close to the witnesses? 
seems like really brazen behavior and somewhat counterintuitive for a secret military aircraft. 
But again, these cases almost always raise more questions than answers. So, I'm just presenting 
the facts as we know them, and you can make up your own minds about it. But there you go. 
10 cases of extraterrestrial humanoids from all over the world. Mostly grays and humanl looking 
figures which are the top categories certainly in my own files but the variation is amazing and 
we see that sort of tanned gray with long white hair. Can't say I've heard that before. So there 
is this amazing variation among these humanoids which again raises all kinds of questions. 
That's why this research is so important so we can fully understand what's going on here, who these 
beings are, where they come from, and why they are here. What's clear to me is that this is going 
on. There is no way this can be explained away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, and mental 
illness. There are enough cases, I think, that the cover up is going to collapse at some point. 
disclosure is inevitable and we're beginning to see that. So, sort of a new era is dawning for 
humanity as the truth is coming out. So, that's it. Thank you guys very much for watching. I 
truly appreciate it. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for 
the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next time. Bye for now.
