UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE FOURTEEN
Dec 12, 2025

Summary:
Dec 12, 2025 (1:27:47)
Welcome to "UFOs in Your Hometown: Episode Fourteen," the ongoing UFO investigative series proving 
that UFOs are being seen everywhere on this planet. This series was born from a challenge: name 
any town, city or location on this planet, and I will find a UFO encounter there. You (the viewers) 
have provided almost 1000 suggestions. So far we have explored almost 200 locations, and ALL of 
them have a history of UFO encounters. These include not just sightings, but landings, humanoids, 
onboard encounters and more.

In this latest installment, we explore ten new locations from across the planet, each with a long, 
rich history of UFO encounters, including:

1. Debighshire/Flintshire, Wales.
2. Baxter Springs, Kansas.
3. Kerrville, Texas.
4. DeRidder, Louisiana.
5. Manitowoc, Wisconsin.
6. Muscatine, Iowa.
7. Methuen, Massachusetts.
8. Tupelo, Mississippi.
9. Wallingford, Connecticut.
10. Waukegan, Illinois.

The cases presented here include almost the entire range of UFO encounters. Many are supported by 
firsthand multiple eyewitness testimony and a wide variety of evidence such as landing traces, 
physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more.

If UFOs are truly being seen everywhere (and this is what the evidence is showing us,) then the 
implications of this are profound. First it shows that UFO encounters are far more common than 
previously believed. According to some estimates there are about 50,000 major cities in the 
world. If you add in small towns, the number jumps into the millions. It doesn't take a 
mathematician to calculate that there must be several million recorded UFO cases. 

Another important takeaway is that the UFO occupants appear to be conducting a planetwide 
publicity campaign, announcing their presence to all of humanity. The conclusion is almost 
inescapable: UFOs want to be seen.

Perhaps the most important revelation from this hometown series is that UFOs are real. There 
are far too many cases to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions or mental 
illness.

While there is a demonstrable worldwide coverup of UFO information by our own governments, 
ETs have done their part to disclose their presence and counteract the UFO coverup. The 
rest is up to us!

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of 
"UFOs in the Paranormal". I truly appreciate it. And guess what? It's been a long time coming. A 
lot of you have been asking about it. It's time for a new episode of UFOs in Your Hometown. So, 
I'm calling this one UFOs in Your Hometown, episode 14. This is part of my ongoing quest 
to prove that UFOs are being seen everywhere on this planet. I've explored about 150 almost 200 
locations still betting 100% proving that there's UFO encounters pretty much in every location. So, 
I've got 10 locations for you today, 10 towns and cities. And these include Wales, two towns 
in Wales, including Flintshshire and Debon Deon Flintshshire and Debbishier. Also, Baxter Springs, 
Kansas, Kurville, Texas. Derritter, Louisiana, Manatawak, Wisconsin, Musketine, 
Iowa, Mthuan, Massachusetts, Tupelo, Mississippi, Wallingford, Connecticut, and Walkegan, Illinois. 
While these do take a lot of time and research, it's so much fun to find these little gems, 
these cases that really most people have not heard about. But it's amazing because they have been 
covered in local newspapers or appear in various databases of UFO organizations. The cases I found 
for you today include the entire range of UFO encounters. So we have cases of simple sightings, 
close encounters of the first kind, quite a few cases of close encounters of the second 
kind where UFOs affect the environment in some way, but of course close encounters of the third 
kind where people see humanoids of some kind and of course the fourth kind as well in which people 
are taken on board a craft. So those of you who are looking for humanoids will definitely find 
some in this episode. also all kinds of evidence including landing traces and animal reactions, 
electromagnetic effects and physiological effects and even photographs. That's really one of the fun 
things about doing these kinds of episodes is this evidence almost always turns up. So, this is going 
to cover 10 locations. It's going to be a pretty long episode. I'm trying to get through this list. 
I have like a thousand places to look up. So, for those of you who are waiting for your town to be 
covered, please be patient. I'll try to get there, but again, this does take a lot of effort. So, 
let's just get to our first location today, which is Flintshshire and Debbenshere. And 
this was requested by Carmen W. Again, this is in Wales. I found more than a dozen cases. Again, 
the full spectrum of encounters in this one, which is a lot for a fairly small town. So, 
I really want to thank you, Carmen, for suggesting this location. Some of these cases are just so 
interesting and I think have quite a bit to reveal about why ETSs are here and how they behave. 
An early case of a classic flying disc occurred on the night of May 13, 1967 when a young man 
was driving in Rexen, Denbasher, and saw a bright flash in the clouds. He immediately 
noticed an object rapidly approaching and then hovering silently about 180 ft above him. The 
light dimmed to reveal a discshaped craft, blue gray on the top and dark gray on the bottom. It 
quickly darted off, becoming bright again, where it was also viewed by a truck driver. 
The next one occurred one night in May 1970 when Fred Sheriff and his wife saw a cigar-shaped craft 
described as two saucers joined rimto- rim. As Fred says, it was as if it was right on top of my 
car. They reportedly were able to photograph the object, though I could not find the photograph. 
Now, here's an account of a brief but very intense UFO wave in Flintshshire, and it appears in the 
spring 1974 issue of the Bupora Journal. Was early on the evening of October 10, 1970 when three 
separate neighbors noticed a saucer-shaped object circling around the BBC television mast. The first 
saucer was followed by four or five others, all of which went around the mast one by one and 
then shot off. It was clear to the witnesses that they were investigating the mast in some way. The 
discs seemed to have strange appendages on them. Two days later, another separate witness saw two 
glowing orange red objects approach the mast and dart away. And the next day, the same witness said 
her television picture went haywire, which she connects somehow to the prior night's sighting. 
But on October 15 at 7:40 p.m., one of the initial witnesses reported yet another sighting, which he 
described as quote, "An object like a huge saucer on its side." But this was again in the vicinity 
of this TV antenna was followed by a few other discs. They were so bright that it actually hurt 
his eyes to look at them. And following this, the sighting stopped. But all the witnesses agree that 
the discs seem to show a very special interest in this television antenna, which makes sense because 
we have a lot of cases where ETSs are showing interest in our technology. This next case is 
quite brief, but it's a very compelling humanoid case, which comes from researcher Margaret Fry. 
The witness, a woman from Hulen, Flintshshire, says that in July of 1982, she saw what she first 
thought was a meteorite hurtling through the sky. Then stopped over a neighbor's home, and 
she saw that it was actually a large round object, yellow in color, with two rings around it, and it 
was making a humming noise. And it was just over a year later in November 1983, that she was awakened 
by a bright light shining into her bedroom. And outside her bedroom window, just 20 feet off the 
ground, a human-looking face was peering into her room. And suddenly, the figure was in her room and 
disappeared shortly later. And this was just the beginning, she said, a regular contacts with what 
she believes are quote, people from outer space. I have no more information in that case, but it 
certainly sounds interesting. And here's another. On January 3rd, 1986, an incident involving a UFO 
investigating a TV antenna again occurred at a farm in Badfari Deig when the Edwards family of 
five saw a disc with blue, red, green, and yellow lights hovering for, get this, over 
one hour just above the television reception mast on Parro Mountain. Few hours later, a government 
officer known only as Miss J was driving along the A547 highway when she saw a red oval object 
descend and land among the trees, illuminating a wide area. And the next day, another witnesses, 
Miss P, said that she saw an oval-shaped object 40 feet wide hovering very low, actually between two 
pine trees. And unknown to her, her neighbors also saw what appears to be the same object a few hours 
later hovering over their farm's electric lines. Next case occurred in January of 1990 when Pat 
Koulson discovered three circles in a triangular formation on her 33 acre farm in the moors. 
Researcher Margaret Fry investigated the case and adds quote there have been some unusual sightings 
on the debig moors and in one case a farmer was chased to his door by a UFO. A really impressive 
sighting occurred on December 22nd, 1992 when two 15-year-old boys were bicycling along the 
B5429 near Badfari when they saw a very bright flash of light which coalesed into the shape of 
a large blue triangle which they said was about the size of three houses. It hovered 100 ft above 
the ground and had white sparks coming out from either side of the triangle. The next night, 
other witnesses saw it. Researchers speculate that the craft were traveling along lay lines 
which are believed to converge in the area. On May 12th, 1994, a security guard reported his 
sighting of a large craft hovering over a quarry. A month and a half later, a woman described her 
sighting of orange and red lights darting around over Badfari. These are all in the same area. 
A very impressive sighting of a solid craft occurred in November 1997 when nightclub owner 
David Fuls saw a massive top-shaped craft in a field. As he says, it was absolutely huge and 
shaped like a massive spinning top. Was covered with thousands of lights and lit up the whole 
area. I was so shocked the car almost left the road, but I thought I might be seeing things. So, 
I drove on. Then I stopped and turned around and it was hovering over the crearyy. Then it just 
disappeared. I still can't believe it. Always more cases. And this one's really interesting. On July 
28, 1999, paraglider Noel Humphre was paragliding near Badfari. Shortly after landing on the edge of 
the town's golf course, he saw and photographed an unidentified flying object. It looked a bit like 
a disc. I quickly moved in to have a closer look. My camera was with me, so I took a picture. Now, 
he wondered at first if it could be a model plane, but there was no noise coming from it. 
And he decided it couldn't be a trick played on him because his landing had been unplanned. 
And as Noel says, it looked like a UFO and it looked as if it was hanging around the trees. I 
really can't explain what it was. I didn't feel scared, just puzzled as to what was going on. 
I didn't recognize it and I was really intrigued by it because I've always been skeptical of UFOs. 
Here's a more recent case. Christmas Day 2007 as Harry Hughes and his wife Pam were in the front 
yard of their home on Gray's Road. You can see it here when they saw UFOs right above their home. As 
Harry says, I looked up and saw what looked like five bright orangey red fireballs flying through 
the sky. They were traveling quite fast, about 10 to 12 seconds apart, and were revolving. They 
were traveling too fast to be aircraft and were completely silent. So he called out his wife, 
who also saw them. It turned out that several others also saw them too, including David Clark, 
who says that he also saw three bright lights, one of which actually separated from the others 
and flew straight up. As he says, "At first we thought they were balloons or planes. They were 
going too fast and they didn't look like planes. There was no noise whatsoever. They were going 
so fast. I have never seen anything like that before. Another witness was Mrs. Koulson who said, 
quote, "It was coming towards us, then stopped and went backwards, stayed still for about four to 5 
minutes, then darted away. It was really strange. We really don't know what it was." Marie Davis of 
Chester Road says, "I couldn't believe my eyes. I would like to see it again. It was very weird. So, 
this turned out to be one of many reports around that time because just a few days later on New 
Year's Day 2008, Mike Jones of Sitchton reported his sighting of two similar objects. As he says, 
it was about 1 10 a.m. That's how two orange lights in the sky, both traveling at the same 
speed with no sound at all. Then they just disappeared. They definitely were not planes 
or helicopters. They were something strange. A few days later, on January 6, James Holmes, 
age 10, says that he was awakened by strange lights shining in through his bedroom window. 
His mother confirmed she also saw the strange lights, but she didn't think too much of it. 
Now, the newspaper, The Evening Leader, published articles about these sightings, 
which continued to bring in more reports from people all over the area. And all of the witnesses 
described orange lights moving very fast. And one gentleman reported as seeing as many as seven 
of these objects. And even as late as October of 2008, reports were coming in, including from the 
mayor of Flintshshire, Terry Renshaw, who had a rare daylight sighting. As he says, it looked like 
a big flexible aluminum pipe and it was traveling very fast with no sound. He took a picture of it, 
but when he developed the film, all he caught was clear blue sky. So, I'll just close out the 
Flintshshire and Debishure Denbasher. So, I'll just close out the Flintshshire and Denbasher 
Wales sightings by referring everyone to a fulllength book, The Dembig Lights by Gary Jones. 
which has many other incidents showing without a doubt that this area has been repeatedly visited 
by UFOs. Thank you very much, Carmen. I learned a lot about UFOs just from exploring what's going on 
in Flintshshire and Denbasher. Really interesting. Some of these encounters were like, "Wow." Yeah, 
every case I think has something to teach us and I definitely learned some stuff there. So, now let's 
move on to our next location, which is Baxter Springs, can Kansas. So, this was suggested by on 
the GoPro, and you did a pretty sneaky method for getting me to cover this case quickly, uh, kind of 
betting me that you had me stumped. Nope. I found some cases for you. Not a lot, but you know, four 
cases for a small town of less than 4,000 people, I think is pretty good considering that the vast 
majority of people do not report anything. But yeah, I found some on the GoPro, so I win the bet. 
Uh, I think you'll find it pretty interesting. I certainly hope so. At 6:45 a.m. in early December 
1988, a woman was driving to Baxter Springs from Galina when she says she saw a bright light to the 
south and looking closer saw that it was actually an L-shaped gray craft slightly larger than a 
small plane, perfectly smooth with no windows. She said it moved in absolute silence. So she 
kept her eye on it, watching it until she reached her place of employment in Baxter, at which point 
this object flew north at low altitude over the city. So that's the first case I could find in 
Baxter Springs, but there are others. In early October 1989, a mini wave of sightings hit the 
area. Bruce Weaver told reporters, "I saw three of them just tonight. They were red and hovering over 
the ground. And there were a lot of witnesses. An employee at the local FastTrip food store said, 
"Drive down any road where it's dark, you'll see them." Another witness was Jolita Inger Sauce, 
and she says she saw these lights near Commerce. As she says, two of them came together. They were 
red and made a funny noise when they flew over my house. Sounded kind of like an airplane, 
but quiet. Ottawa County Deputy Ron Mador said, "We've had eight or 10 sightings tonight. They've 
just been spotted all over the place." In fact, on the night of October 18, 1989, police in 
Cherokee County and Baxter Springs received a series of calls from local residents reporting 
UFOs. The calls began around 8:00 p.m. And Galina Police Chief Pat Collins, you can see him here, 
set out to see the lights himself and saw them. He described seeing different colored objects, 
white, red, orange, all hovering and then moving off. Another witness was Baxter Springs Police 
Chief Jerry Norin. You can see him here. He said his office received only one call, 
but the witness said that they were able to capture a photograph of the objects, 
which unfortunately was not published. Another witness, Barbara Orender of Baxter Springs, says, 
and I quote, "I saw these two red lights in the sky. When we got back out there, the lights had 
turned blue. They just sat there and hovered for a while, and you could hear a whizzing sound coming 
from them. What I saw was not an airplane. They weren't that far away, and you could see them 
real well. When I first saw them, they were real close, and they just went around and around. Now, 
some people are skeptical that these lights could be planes or satellites or actually 
spook lights which are known to appear regularly not too far away in Joplain, Missouri. But many 
of the witnesses who saw this as no way. These are not planes, satellites, or spook lights, but 
something much stranger. A final sighting occurred on December 13, 2011. The witness described seeing 
no less than 15 orange orbs floating in four separate groups in a kind of square formation. 
He said they made no sound. Several were floating alone across the sky. He estimated that they were 
about 1,000 ft high, not very high. And he wasn't alone. He was with two other people 
who also saw these strange objects. There you go on the GoPro. I told you I could find something. 
And I did. True. their only sightings, but still it proves my point that UFOs are ubiquitous. They 
are being seen everywhere. So, now let's move to the next location, which is Kurville, Texas. I 
want to thank you, Randy Terrell, for suggesting this location cuz I found quite a few cases. This 
is a fairly large area with about 25,000 people. I found 10 cases, some really high quality cases in 
this one. undeniably cases involving genuine UFOs, close encounters of the second kind, 
and so forth. So, I think you'll find it pretty interesting. It's really a fascinating history 
of UFOs in this town, Kurville, Texas. The first sighting to get any real publicity in Kurville, 
Texas, occurred on January 9, 1953. It's actually a close encounter of the second kind. Britt Lamb, 
an engineer at KEVT radio station, reported his sighting of a quote, red orange oval-shaped object 
which circled the city. And at the same time, he said that there was a very unusual interference 
is how he put it on the station's transmission. He described it as quote most weird and said it was 
quote like heavy static with a roar that traveled up and down the scale. He absolutely attributes 
this radio interference to the appearance of this object. And there were other witnesses including 
Ivan Young, age 13, and Edgar Rasmusen, age 14, who together saw this object approach Kurville 
from the west and circle around the city and then disappear to the north. They said it was 
oval-shaped and had what looked to them like two fins on the rear that were shooting out red and 
green flames quote like lightning. They said it traveled quote much faster than a plane. They also 
said that it gave off quote a buzzing ringing noise. So a pretty interesting early sighting. 
7 years later, October 9, 1960, at 8:05 p.m., seven students reported their sighting of what 
they described as a pastel green luminous sphere. Moved from roughly north to south, from horizon to 
horizon in about 5 seconds, and had a very unusual kind of self-reflective or self-luminous color. 
So this report actually found its way to project blue book and per Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence J. 
Tacker, their conclusion was fireball. Hard to say for sure. At any rate, I don't really 
trust Blue Book. Now, here's another interesting little story about Kurville from Whitley Strieber. 
Actually comes from his sister. And as Whitley Strieber writes, sometime in the early 1960s, 
she was driving between Kurville and Comfort, Texas, well after midnight, she was terrified to 
see a huge light sail down and cross the road in front of her. A few minutes later, an owl flew in 
front of the car. I have to wonder if that is not a screen memory, but my sister has no sense that 
it is. So those of you who might not know this, but owls are very closely associated with some UFO 
sightings and often thought to be a screen memory or some weird connection there. Next case occurred 
one evening in December 1968. A group of students and law enforcement officials observed an unknown 
object flashing red, green, and yellow lights. It traveled northeast of Kurville at high altitude. 
Another case occurred roughly around that same time 1968 to 1971 and was reported to Mufon in 
2012 decades later. The sighting occurred as this witness stood outside his home one 
morning facing south waiting for his mother to take him to school. This is when he heard the 
sound of an engine of some kind and looking up saw a 60foot cargo plane with its engines 
screaming at full throttle coming towards him. As his house was on a hill overlooking a valley, 
this plane was actually just below his eye level. And as the witness says, it appeared to be pursued 
by two bulletshaped objects. They changed position relative to the airplane as they zoomed overhead. 
One came from behind to above the plane and the other from one side of the plane to in front as 
if leading it. The objects were about 20 ft long, flat gray in color with an orange tip and a flat 
orange band around the back end. They disappeared above and behind me over the top of the hill. So, 
he's convinced that those were UFOs kind of tracking this plane. An astonishing sighting 
involved three witnesses and was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center. It occurred one 
evening in May of 1979. The reporting witness was 7 years old at the time and he was with his 
mother as they drove to the grocery store. And as the witness says, as soon as we came out of 
the treecovered road from our house, I spotted a gloriously beautiful long diamond-shaped craft 
right outside the car window. Was on the other side of the treeine from the road, but clearly 
visible. It resembled two cones with their bases put together. It was maybe the size of a grain 
silo in diameter, but it was covered with lights with seemingly no rhyme or reason to the layout. 
The lights were different color and flashed in no pattern. So he tried to tell his mother, but she 
was clearly terrified and in fact she was driving at 80 m hour and told him to ignore this craft. 
Now this craft actually followed them into town just yards away from their car for several miles, 
then hovered momentarily and winked out. And when the witness tried to talk to his mother about it, 
she refused and she said that it was just his imagination. And as he says, her reaction 
frightened me. But it was just one week later that the witness's older brother, age 10, came 
running very excited into the house and said that he and his friend were packing up their fishing 
gear when this giant craft, which he described in the same way, appeared and hovered overhead. 
He said it made no sound, but he could feel this faint buzzing in his body. He said this craft 
emitted a bright foggy light directly onto him and his friend that made them feel warm and tingly. 
Then suddenly it vanished. A pretty amazing encounter. An equally astonishing encounter 
occurred on March 3rd, 1980 to two women, Karen Styler, a high school chemistry teacher, and 
Elizabeth Barnes, a fourth grade teacher. So, good witnesses. They were driving along the Highway 46 
between San Marcos and Kurville to attend a class. This is a route that they traveled regularly. 
But on the evening in question, it came over a hill and saw what they described as an intensely 
brilliant rounded blue object. As soon as it came into view, it rose up from the ground, 
illuminated the treetops brilliantly, and darted off. And as Karen Styler says, I have never 
seen anything before that I could not explain. There must be a reasonable explanation for this, 
but I cannot imagine what it could be. So, there's no real information about this next sighting 
other than it comes from the Department of Public Safety dispatcher who had a sighting of something 
unexplained over Kurville in December of 1980. And he wrote in a public statement saying only, 
"I don't believe in little green men, but I'd like to know what it was." Now, here's a really 
interesting encounter which was reported by Luke Liddell Fowler. He was a camp counselor 
for a camp located just outside of Kurville. Was a clear summer night in 2007, 11 p.m. as he and 
two other camp counselors were outside when they all saw a strange craft moving among the stars. As 
Luke writes, I immediately pointed out the craft to them and they also immediately saw it. It was 
three white lights in the shape of a triangle moving slowly across the night sky. It seemed to 
be a very giant craft, possibly thousands of feet in diameter. It was blocking out stars as it moved 
across the sky. So, it was pretty high up there. He estimates perhaps 100,000 ft in altitude. And 
after about 2 minutes, each light went off in sequence and the object disappeared from view. 
There was an interesting aftermath because two weeks later, one of the counselors was watching 
a UFO show on television and was startled to see a video from someone who said that they had filmed a 
UFO outside Kurville which turned to be around the same time as their sighting. So, as he's watching 
this video and to his amazement, it showed the same object or what appeared to be the same craft. 
Now, here's a real recent case which was reported to Mufon in 2019. The couple was standing outside 
their Curveville home when they both noticed that they had been engulfed in a huge spotlight coming 
from above. And as the witness says, it wasn't a regular light. Looked almost like a bright blue 
highbeam. It hovered over us slowly, and just when I looked up to see what it was, I noticed how huge 
a light it was, along with a circular shape it had. After a few seconds of me staring at it, 
it darted off to the west. As it moved off, the witness could just discern a kind of V formation. 
But the couple was left absolutely puzzled by this sighting and said that the circle of light was far 
too large to be a plane. There you go. Perville, Texas definitely has a history of encounters. And 
I keep saying it, every location on this planet has a history of encounters. It's amazing to me 
because that just means that there's got to be probably gosh, hundreds of millions of encounters 
out there that really haven't been put into any worldwide organized database. What we have is 
all these scattered databases all over the world. And a good number of them have never even been put 
in these databases because I'm getting a lot of these cases from obscure little newspaper 
articles published in these tiny newspapers. So let's move to the next location. This one is also 
really interesting. This is Ditter, Louisiana. This was requested by a couple of you including 
Good John Jr. and Bogard, Paris. So, thank you so much, guys, for suggesting this town. This 
is a pretty small town, some 10 to 15,000 people. So, I didn't find a lot, just four cases, but I 
think these are all highquality cases. And in each of these locations, honestly, I have found more, 
but they're unexplained lights at night, somewhat ambiguous, and don't have a whole lot to teach 
us about UFOs. So I kind of just pass over those cases because while each case does have something 
to offer in terms of our understanding of this phenomena, I'm much more interested in cases 
that have a little bit more meat to them. So yeah, I found four for you today. Thank you. 
Good John Jr. and Bo Regard Paris. I hope you find this interesting. On April 5, 1957, this 
was actually during the Levland, Texas UFO wave, a huge wave of sightings, a gentleman in Derritter, 
Louisiana became concerned when the dogs in the living room began growling, and the cows outside 
in the pasture began mooing excitedly. Looking outside, he saw a huge white light growing in 
intensity and pulsating in brilliance. and it actually remained there for about 15 minutes and 
then disappeared at which point the animals calmed down. So that's a good case of an animal reaction 
sighting. Apparently quite a few of these kinds of sightings in Ditter because here's another one. 
January 4th, 2004 at 7:50 p.m., three witnesses saw what they described as a flying triangle 
with red lights on the points and white lights in the center hovering in the western sky. They said 
Air Force planes were flying around it and at the time of their sighting, their dog was barking. So, 
an a brief but interesting case. Here's another involving animal reactions which occurred at 
11 p.m. on April 5, 2018. The witness was at his farm when he noticed that the cows in the pasture 
across the street were mooing loudly. So, he went to the large westfacing picture window in his 
living room, expecting to see coyotes or perhaps some other animals spooking the cows. And instead, 
he saw something else. As he says, I observed a huge round white light traveling slowly towards my 
direction. The light became larger and brighter, then appeared to stop and began pulsating. This 
continued for 15 minutes. Then, like flicking off a light switch, it was gone. As soon as it 
disappeared, the cows quieted and my dog stopped growling. I was very curious and tried to reason 
out what it could be. Now, the witness was puzzled that his own dogs weren't barking, 
and he says that this was not his first UFO sighting in this area. So, yeah, we're we're only 
touching the tip of the iceberg here. One final case in Derritter on September 16, 2021, William 
Champagne posted a photograph of an object that he said flew directly over his house in Ditter. 
I have no other information on this case, but it certainly is interesting because he photographed 
it. There you go. More proof that UFOs are being seen everywhere, including in Derritter, 
Louisiana. Thank you, Good John Jr. and Bo Regard, Paris. Super interesting. Now, let's move to the 
next location, which is Manatawak, Wisconsin. This was requested by Opposite Pickle. So, thank you, 
Opposite Pickle. I truly appreciate it. This was actually really interesting. I found only 
four cases, but each one of them was particularly fascinating, and one involves direct contact with 
apparently a humanoid. What's really interesting about Manatawak is it does have this interesting 
history. It turns out that Sputnik crashed there, the Russian satellite, crashed there in 1962. 
It's also supposedly the birthplace of the Ice Cream Sunday. It's not a huge town, some 
35,000 people. Definitely not small. I was really expecting to find more cases there. And again, 
I did find a bunch of unexplained lights, but I like to present cases again that are more 
substantial and have something to teach us and are wellverified or unusual in some way. 
But definitely Manetwalk has a history of UFO encounters. So, thank you, Opposite Pickle. I 
hope you find this interesting. Well, I could only find floor cases in Manatawak. They sure 
are interesting, especially this first one. The witnesses in this case are two nuns from the Holy 
Family Convent on Alurno Road in Manatawak. You can see it here. They called the county 
sheriff's office to report their sighting. It was about 8:30 p.m. on April 12, 1958, 
and one of the sisters had heard on the radio that Sputnik 2 might be visible. She had seen it a few 
times and wanted to see it again. And looking out to the southwest, she saw a star-like object 
which suddenly disappeared. But meanwhile, another object appeared, and she watched it as it seemed 
to drop gradually from the sky. After watching it for about 10 minutes, she called out another 
witness. And as the sister says, as we watched, it seemed to hover over the ground, but not touch it. 
It seemed to be about 5 ft above the ground, then would flare up to a rather bright light, 
and then it would move around back and forth past one spot, but still the light was very bright. 
Now the other sister verifies this and says the white object seemed to be going back and 
forth uncertain whether to land or not. It had the appearance of a bright ball of light. There 
seemed to be a protrusion which gave it a sort of cone shape and also an outline of red. The 
object was seen at intervals. The red object was very small. I couldn't tell what shape. It fell 
in a very uneven and slow manner. It wasn't a bright light. So she went off to get a pair 
of binoculars and as the first nun says just as she left the object flared up and seemed like it 
was going to explode. Different colors came from it. There were different shades of orange, blue, 
etc. It looked like it was going to burst into flames. By the time the sister came back, 
it had gone to a white light. So, they continued watching this for a total of about 3 hours, at 
which point it appeared to have actually landed in the field. It was at this point that they called 
the sheriff's office. Two deputies showed up shortly later, and they also viewed this object. 
They ventured out into the field to get a closer look, at which point this object disappeared. 
So this sighting was reported to right field and instead of showing any real interest 
in the sighting itself, they seemed far more concerned about public relations. as they wrote, 
"Aside from the obligation imposed upon the Air Force to resolve the sightings, the unquestionable 
reliability and integrity of the observers could be exploited to the adverse interests of the Air 
Force by UFO clubs and flying saucer proponents if brought to the attention of the general public. 
This is particularly true if it is shown that no further action was taken or found inconclusive 
on the part of the air force. So basically to quell interest in the nuns accounts the 
air force debunked this sighting and they said it was quote the star beetlejuice and pollock 
which is so ridiculous but that's the air force for you. Now here's another interesting sighting 
in Nanattowak. It was at 1:45 a.m. on April 23rd, 1961, that Thomas Wiznookski, he was an employee 
for the Milwaukee Journal, described his sighting of a dull, gray disc-like object. He said it was 
revolving and moving slowly from east to west over the city. And while this object was in view, 
he said it could hear it emitting a sound, which he said was quote, "Like rushing wind." Another 
case occurred years later on March 21st, 1994. There were several witnesses who called the police 
to report strange lights over the city. Detective Captain Roger Hartman took the calls and said that 
the witness's descriptions were very consistent. All described seeing airborne lights, white, blue, 
and red. He sent out deputies to investigate, but by that time the lights had disappeared. 
calls to the Coast Guard revealed that they were not doing any military maneuvers. So 
ultimately these lights remain unexplained. Now this next case is a very interesting on 
board UFO encounter which was reported by the witness to Muon who says that on January 8, 
2015 he had been suffering from a headache on the day prior to all this. Going to sleep, 
he woke up at about 2:00 a.m. to sense a presence in the room. And he said he felt strangely secure 
as a female voice telepathically instructed him to go outside and he as he says she made me feel 
calm. He was then instructed to look up and when he did he saw a luminous disc which he said would 
looked about 30 ft wide. It immediately descended silently to about 10 ft above the ground. And then 
he says he felt this kind of quote energy quote like a magnet. It actually pulled him up into the 
craft at a 45° angle. He felt no pain or anything like that, no fear, just a very calm feeling. And 
as the witness says, the next thing I remember is floating over my bed for a few seconds, 
then being placed back in it by four beings. He couldn't really see them well as the room was very 
dark. He was unable to move at this point, but he did notice that they had placed him sideways in 
the bed. And as he says, "That bothered me." And as soon as I thought this, as though they were 
reading my thoughts, they immediately refloated me and straightened me out with the bed so my 
head was on the pillows and I felt my covers being placed on me. Now, at this point, he did 
get a brief look at the figures. He described them as quote, "short people in my room, just 
a dark gray silhouette about as tall as me." He woke up the next day to feel a strange itchiness 
in his hip. And examining it, he saw a V-shaped mark and a slight bruise. The witness says he 
does have a history of encounters, but as he says, this is my most vivid visit. And like the others, 
all have been good and very comforting. There you go. Opposite Pickle, Manatawak definitely has UFO 
encounters and definitely some really interesting ones as well. It's funny because most people don't 
report their encounters and that's especially true if it involves humanoids or an onboard experience. 
So, those are a lot more difficult to find in these locations, but I found one, 
which just goes to show that this is something that is very widespread. I keep saying it, 
but that's the whole point of this series, which was born from a challenge basically that I didn't 
know how well it was going to do. So, I'm really impressed that I'm still able to find all these 
cases, which is thanks 100% to the people who have had these encounters and found the courage 
and strength to step forward in a very hostile climate of skepticism and fear and gaslighting 
and ridicule. So, really all the kudos go to the witnesses who have reported these encounters. Now, 
let's move to the next location which is Musketine, Iowa. This was suggested by Elizabeth 
Man. So, thank you, Elizabeth. This was pretty interesting because I found quite a few cases in 
this one. This town is famous for being visited by Mark Twain. And it's also got the interesting 
distinction of being the only town in the United States with that name. It's not a huge town, 
about 24,000 people, so kind of midsize, but I found quite a few really interesting cases. 
Definitely some interesting cases in Musketone, Iowa. The first occurred on April 6, 1950 when a 
housewife described her sighting of an object that looked quote like a ball of fire from a 
Roman candle. She said it flew from the northwest to the southeast, disappearing into the distance 
and leaving what looked to her like a vapor trail behind it. Earlier that day, there were 
several other sightings of a UFO over Burlington and Rearen, which is only about 50 miles to the 
south. Obviously, not far as the UFO flies. Now, here's a photograph from Dave Crook, admin for 
the Facebook group called Musketine History and Memories, and he posted this UFO photograph, 
which was apparently taken on September 25, 1965 with the caption, "UFO sighting." in Musket, 
Iowa. Size of a football field with ice crystalike lights on the bottom. In parenthesis, he wrote, 
"I don't remember this, but this does appear to be an interesting photograph of a UFO at treetop 
level during the daytime, which is quite rare. Here's another pretty interesting case. 1969 to 
1970 thereabouts. Don Williams, a toeboat operator of Williams Marine Enterprises, was amazed to see 
a brilliant star-like object hovering over the Mississippi River. This is outside of Musketine. 
He watched it for only a few minutes, watching it drop smaller objects and then disappear, but 
he was very much impressed that it was something unusual and was even more impressed a few months 
later when he was down in Musketine proper and he saw it again. as he says. This time I hollered, 
"Hey Ali, take a look at this." And I told him what was going to happen and didn't any more 
than get that out when blink the lights started dropping. The brightness was about the same, 
like a fast parachute jumper. Only this time, I could see four lights in the sky at one time. We 
watched them all drop below the horizon in about 3 minutes. So, close encounter of the first kind, 
but definitely kind of interesting. Another case occurred on July 21st, 1981. The police received 
three separate calls from Musketone residents reporting UFOs. The first came shortly after 
midnight when Randy Reynolds of 809 Popular Street told police that he saw a quote large orange disc 
fly overhead, appearing to change in shape from a disc to a cone. This is probably a matter of 
perspective. But then something really interesting happened. Another amazing sighting. This one is 
definitely a close encounter of the second kind. It was 3 hours later that Alan Wagner, 
a toll taker at the Norbert F. Beckley Bridge over the river, called the police to report 
his sighting of a large orange disc. He said that that morning he was getting ready to feed the wild 
rabbits as was his habit and usually they flee from him. But this time he saw that this was so 
unusual they were stretched out flat on the cement pavement unmoving. And this is when he noticed 
this large orange disc hovering over the treetops on the far side of the river. He estimates it was 
about 30 feet in diameter. And in his case, he said that this object quote made a whizzing sound 
as it flew off. The object was about 150 ft off the ground, 750 ft away from him. And as it moved, 
it cleared the highest part of the bridge by only 10 ft. So that's a pretty low altitude sighting, 
and interesting how it had this effect on these rabbits. A third person anonymously reported what 
was apparently the same orange craft moving over the river and reportedly police officers 
patrolling the area heard a strange quote whizzing sound but did not see the object itself. Barbara 
Shute, a field investigator for the Center of UFO Studies said, quote, "It's the best sighting the 
center has had for a while." And she later learned that just before the sighting there was a power 
outage. Though there does not appear to be a connection to the sighting because according 
to city officials the power outage was caused by a raccoon who got into the electrical equipment. But 
nevertheless interesting. In November 1983, radio station KFMH in Musketine did a very interesting 
kind of stunt. They decided that they were going to send out a midnight broadcast every Wednesday 
evening for 10 to 15 minutes inviting aliens to come and visit the city. This was because 
of a number of recent sightings. And program director Steve Bridges says we play a message 
of friendship and then play tapes of people who believe in them. We give our location in latitude 
and longitude in English, Samoan, French, Italian, Japanese, Malaysian and other languages. Then we 
ask them to respond. So this was very popular and in fact the station received so many calls from 
people interested in this message that they had to install a separate phone line. Unfortunately, 
while there was a response from the people, there was no apparent response from any ETSs. Now, 
here is another report from MUON involving an apparent missing time encounter. It was 
2:00 a.m. on November 28, 2021. The witness was riding his electric standup scooter near 
Weed Park when something very strange happened. As he says, "I noticed something in the sky, 
like it was heading towards me. The next thing he knew, he was waking up on his couch with vague 
memories of being pulled on board. As the witness says, "I'm absolutely scared." And this is not 
the first time. My witnesses are my roommates who said I was gone when they went to bed and 
they found me on the couch and do not know how I got in because the alarm was still on and hadn't 
been reset by door entry. This is like the fifth time this has happened to me and I have frequent 
deja vu episodes now. Like often I can predict things. Nothing major but it's hard to explain. 
Thank you Elizabeth man for suggesting this town of Musketine Iowa. Super interesting. Pretty much 
having the full range of encounters as well. And always these places have something to teach 
us about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. So let's move to the next location which 
is Methawin, Massachusetts. This was suggested by Anthony Simone. I want to thank you very much. 
This is a pretty large town, 53,000 people. I found seven cases of really high quality, 
including a very intriguing missing time encounter. And when I say seven cases, 
in a town of 53,000 people, you can bet that there is easily closer to 10,000 cases probably. There 
are some studies that show that about 10 to 20% of people have a UFO encounter which is 
probably a vastly underestimated number because again most people don't report it. So that's one 
of the reasons I am doing this research and particularly this series as well to show that 
UFO sightings are far more common than most people realize. So thank you Anthony Simone. I hope you 
find this interesting. The first case that I could find in Methuan generated enormous interest from 
researchers including Raymond Fowler, Jay Allen Heinneck, and James E. Macdonald. It occurred to 
three teenage girls on the evening of January 20, 1967. And it's a classic case of a close 
encounter of the second kind. was 6:30 p.m. as Kimberly Lodge, Ellen Kenny, and Janice Schaefer, 
all ages 16 to 17, were driving along Washington Street on their way to a basketball game. Janice 
was the first to notice a string of 9 to 10 bright glowing red lights hovering at low elevation over 
a field to the left. and they were discussing what it might be when Kim laughed and said, "It 
must be a UFO or a flying saucer." Now, she was just joking, but suddenly it was no longer funny 
because looking at this object, they could see it was hovering in place and spinning on its axis, 
shooting off different colors, was definitely nothing conventional. Kimberly, who was driving, 
stopped the car, leaving the engine on, and they were arguing about whether to get out of the car 
when suddenly the car stalled mysteriously. At the same time, the radio and the lights went off. 
And as Ellen says, then nobody wanted to get out of the car. Truthfully, I was too scared 
to carefully observe the object. She actually crouched down in the back seat. The driver, 
Kimberly, tried repeatedly to restart the car, but it would not work. This object was about 200 
feet away at this point. They could now see it was roughly discshaped and clearly a metallic object, 
which they said looked to be about the size of a house. You can see their drawings here. They could 
see that the generator light on their dashboard did remain on, but was pulsating on and off, which 
was very strange. So they were stranded there next to this UFO for a full 2 minutes and this is when 
the craft finally started moving very slowly at first and then zipped away they said at terrific 
speed. At this point Kimberly was easily able to start the car. And it turned out they were not the 
only witnesses because that same evening about a half hour later at 7 p.m. three other witnesses 
also saw what appears to be the same UFO. They were three miles away from where the girls were. 
Arthur, his daughter Nancy, and her friend Peggy were driving to the same basketball game along Lel 
Street. This is very close to Washington Street. And this is when they noticed a pattern of red, 
blue, green, and yellow lights which looked to be hovering about 300 to 400 ft above the ground. 
Here's another multiple witness case which was very thoroughly investigated by Raymond Fowler. 
that occurred on February 17, 1967 when a sales representative was traveling along Route 93 near 
Methylin when he noticed an object of quote dazzling brilliance was hovering just above 
the road. So he slowed his car and could now see that this object had a bright green frame is how 
he described it. A sort of rectangular display of very bright lights. And as he got closer, he could 
see a flashing red light. And he says this object had a sort of V-shaped appearance and was so large 
that it easily spanned the entire northbound lanes. Made no noise that he could hear. And he 
told Raymond Fowler that he became quote a little afraid of the thing. But he summoned his courage 
and kept driving, actually going directly beneath this object and moving onward. And 
he noticed several other people in their own cars also watching this unusual object. Now, 
it was just about 45 minutes later that another witness, Kenneth Duval, an electrical engineer, 
and his wife were driving the same exact route when they saw what they described as quote, "a 
loose cluster of 8 to nine red, green, and white lights at a low altitude and very slow speed." 
They did not think this was a plane or any conventional aircraft and they watched it pass 
low over the road in its southwest to northeast direction. Now, this next case has very little 
detail, but I thought it was an interesting report which occurred at on February 10, 1979 at 
5:15 a.m. The witness was observing an unexplained light that he said was changing from a star-like 
light to a glowing sphere and back about four times. And he says that he was then taken into 
the object and found himself back in his vehicle about 1 hour later. So, I'm sure there's more to 
that case. It sounds like an onboard encounter. Unfortunately, I have no other details. This very 
interesting close encounter of the second kind occurred on August 13, 1988. It was very early 
morning when the witness heard a loud vibration and banging which shook the whole house for more 
than a few minutes. And thinking the boiler was about to explode, she ran into her father's room 
to warn him. He of course was already awake and he realized that the sound was actually coming 
from above the house. So he ran outside and was shocked to see quote some type of unknown craft 
large and dark just above the treeine across the street and moving away slowly, very slowly. So the 
next day they found strange evidence apparently related to this encounter. As they say, a large 
maple tree in front of the house had tiny broken limbs all over the ground under the tree. They 
were basketball- sized clusters on the ground. It was an abnormal sight. The strange thing was 
the clusters were directly under the tree and not scattered about, which indicates a direct downward 
energy. Solid evidence that something went over the house as the tree was taller than the house. 
They also found out that many people had called the police that night about a loud craft flying 
over the area. So apparently they weren't the only witnesses. Now here's another case which occurred 
just a few months later on December 11, 1988. The witness described his sighting of a massive object 
hovering directly over the Methuan Mall. She says it looked as big as a quote threestory hotel. She 
called the Lawrence Eagle Tribune and reported to them because they had just published a UFO story 
the week before. And she reported it because, as she says, I would like to find out if somebody 
else saw it. I'm guessing somebody did, but again, most people don't report their encounters. Here 
is a final and very odd case involving missing time which comes from a gentleman who says that 
on March 1st, 1988, he decided to take a nap before his 11:00 p.m. to 700 a.m. night shift 
at the local hotel in Mthan. Waking up from his nap, he was shocked to see it was 3:00 a.m. So, 
he was 4 hours late for work, something which had never happened before. So, he called his 
place of employment and said that he was coming in directly. And that's when he learned that 
it was now 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning. It had been Friday when he took this nap. As the witness says, 
I had two days of missing time. It took me several minutes to convince him that I was not joking, but 
I could not explain the missing two days. I lived alone and had never called out or been absent. How 
about that? Two days of missing time. Makes you wonder what was going on during those two days, 
but it's certainly not unique. I mean, we all know Travis Walton was missing for 5 days. I'd like to 
do an episode about that. People who were missing for more than just a few hours because there's 
quite a few cases of people who have had very long periods of missing time. So, interesting. So, 
thank you, Anthony Simone, for suggesting this location. Methuin, Massachusetts. I always learn 
something doing the research for these cases and it's so much fun wondering if I'm going to find 
anything and then finding it and proving my point that UFOs are being seen everywhere. So, next 
location. This is Tupelo, Mississippi, which was suggested by Cedric Lunar. Thank you, Cedric. This 
was really interesting to me. I've been there. My father did a whole job there when he was working 
in the film industry. So I'm familiar with the town somewhat. Of course, it's best known perhaps 
as being the birthplace of Elvis Presley, who is himself a UFO contactee by all accounts and had 
some experiences as a very young child. I didn't include those because I already covered that in my 
episode on celebrities who've seen UFOs. So, if you want to check out Elvis's story, check that 
out because definitely he has had some really amazing encounters. Tupelo is an interesting 
place. The name of the city comes from a Native American word meaning to scream or make a loud 
noise. I found that kind of amusing. This is a town of about 38,000 people roughly according to a 
recent census. And I found about five really high quality cases there. Again, I'm sure that's just 
the tip of the iceberg. But thank you, Cedric. I hope you find this interesting cuz I know I 
sure did. The first case I could find in Tupelo occurred on July 2nd, 1947. This was only days 
before the famous Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash. The witness was Postmaster TA Morris, who said 
that at 6:00 p.m. he saw a silver quote, flying saucer. He said it was flying at high altitude. 
There's no other information on this case other than a few days later, a Mountain Home resident 
and his daughter reported seeing a similar object. The next really solid case I could find occurred 
in late 1973. This was during the time a massive wave was sweeping across the United States with 
numerous reports of humanoids. Actually, the southeastern United States seemed to be the focus 
of most of the activity. But one particularly credible witness was Thomas E. West Morland. He 
was a national park service ranger in Tupelo and he said that on October 3rd, he observed a large 
UFO for a period of a full 15 minutes. As Thomas West Morland says, it was approximately 1,000 ft 
in altitude and roughly the size of a two-bedroom house or a little smaller. It had red, green, and 
yellow flashing lights, not the standard beacon type you have on aircraft. They were circular, 
and they were rotating continuously. Now, he was not alone when he saw this craft, and in fact, 
three other rangers and a deputy sheriff also observed the object. He's not quite ready to 
label this craft as extraterrestrial. And as he says, our theory is that it's some highly secret 
experimental aircraft the Air Force is trying out and doesn't want the public to know about. Now, 
here is a particularly harrowing encounter which occurred to a couple. They had just 
left Apprentice and around midnight on April 4, 1986 were heading north through Tupelo and 
towards Highway 30. Before they reached Highway 30, the wife saw what she described as quote, 
"a huge bright light. It appeared to be hovering over a large soybean field." Now, her husband 
dismissed it as a combine, but as they pulled onto Highway 30 and started traveling westbound, 
they said this object began to pace their car from behind and to the right. And as the wife says, it 
was as large as a football field and had multiple bright lights surrounding the middle and a large 
dome and windows all around. As it followed them, the car radio started sputtering and the radio 
malfunctioned. The wife panicked and screamed at her husband to try to outrun the craft, 
and he told her that the gas pedal was pressed down to the floor. Despite this, the car would 
not go any faster than 20 miles per hour, and the engine continued to sputter. Now, his mother lived 
just a half a mile ahead, so they kept driving. And several minutes later, they pulled into her 
driveway, the car engine still sputtering, and as the wife says, I was in extreme panic with 
my eyes on it the entire time, then shifted up in the air in a blink, paused, and like a flash, it 
went north. So the object was gone but the effects were long lasting because more than 25 years later 
they reported the sighting and as the wife says it has forever impacted my life as I have a huge 
fear of traveling after dark. It made me think we were powerless. It was really the sheer size 
of this object that scared her the most. But she did later learn that her friend, who lived 
just a little further west along Highway 30, also saw this object just a few hours before sunrise 
on the same day that they had seen it. This next encounter was reported by the witness to New Fork, 
the National UFO Reporting Center, a full 35 years after it occurred. The date was March 20, 
1989 approximately. The witness was 18 years old and driving to the store. but weirdly never made 
it. The next thing he knows, he's driving on a two-lane road halfway home. On his way back home, 
he did have a vague memory of stopping at what he thought was a house or going inside a dark 
room of some sort, but now finding himself in his car in a different location, he looks up and saw 
an eggshaped object in the sky at low altitude. As he says, it was about 500 feet in front of my car 
and about 300 feet above the road. Made no sound and glowed like a very bright light bulb. Was so 
bright I could barely see through the light. It looked like a polished aluminum egg half the size 
of a house with a very bright glow all the way around. It said it was visible only a few seconds 
when it darted off. And as he says, "I have never seen anything move that fast again." Now, here 
is a more recent and very unusual sighting which occurred around October 1st, 2003. It was 6 p.m. 
and the witness was walking his dog when he heard the sound of a jet. And looking up, he saw this 
jet and other jets approaching what looked to him like a massive glowing lenticular cloud. was clear 
to him that the pilots were investigating this cloud-like object because they were approaching 
it and flying around it. Taking a closer look, the witness could see that this object was probably 
not a cloud because the edges were very defined and the color was this electric silver blue and 
even color throughout the entire surface of this weird cloud-like object. So he watched this thing 
as it started to actually rotate and went from a horizontal to a vertical position in the space of 
about 30 seconds. So clearly not a cloud because it then began to move in a straight line to the 
west. You could now see that it was about six times the length of the fighter jets and it moved 
off steadily into the distance taking about 20 minutes. And during this whole time, the fighter 
jets were flying back and forth around it. Clearly very interested in whatever this object was. There 
you go. Cedric Lunar, Tupelo, Mississippi definitely has a history of UFO encounters 
and some really interesting ones. It's amazing to me that our governments are still waffling 
about whether or not ETSs or UFOs are even real. They've certainly made steps towards disclosure, 
but when you hear cases like that last one of these fighter jets flying around this apparent UFO 
for that long, any dismissals of this subject are purely disingenuous. They've known for a very long 
time that there is an extraterrestrial presence on our planet and that all of this is real. This 
cover up is still in place. It's amazing to me. And I think that's one of the reasons ETSs are 
visiting everywhere on this planet is to basically announce their presence. So let's move to the next 
location which is Wallingford, Connecticut. This was suggested by Linda Thomas. So thank you very 
much Linda. This one turned out to be particularly interesting. I found seven cases, including a 
couple of direct contact onboard experiences. About 45,000 people live here. This is a pretty 
old town. It was established in 1667. Another little bit of interesting Wallingford history 
is that they had a witch trial back in 1697. That was the last witch trial in that state. But yeah, 
definitely an very interesting history of UFO encounters. So, thank you, Linda. This 
should be interesting for you, I hope. And uh let's just get started. The first case I could 
find in Wallingford, Connecticut, is actually an onboard encounter. The witness is Bob Luca. He's a 
well-known UFO contactee and was actually married to a well-known UFO contactee, Betty Andreasen. 
It was one of his early major encounters. He was 29 years old. It was one day around 11:00 
a.m. in June of 1967 as he drove along Route 68 between Wallingford and Durham. This is again 
in Connecticut. He was heading for the beach when he saw two silver cigar-shaped objects. Suddenly, 
they each ejected a smaller craft which dropped down into the woods ahead of him. The next thing 
he knew, he was arriving at the beach 3 hours later than he should have arrived. So this puzzled 
him for a very long time. Finally, he went under hypnosis and recalled that one of these discs 
actually approached his car and shone down a red beam of light. His car stopped and coming down 
in the beam of light was a gray alien wearing a sort of grayish white metallic looking jumpsuit. 
Bob Luca suddenly found himself inside the craft. He was floated, he said, into a 15 to 20 foot wide 
round room with metallic walls and a white glassy floor. He could see strange gauges and dials on 
one wall, a squish dark cube with what looked like frozen lightning inside of it, and he was 
telepathically instructed to undress and lay out on a table. He said that five gray aliens 
proceeded to examine him using a metallic rod of some kind. A light came down from the ceiling and 
scanned his body. He said it was interesting because these ETs appeared to move in a sort 
of gliding motion. They reassured him repeatedly telepathically that he would not be harmed. He 
also heard them talking among themselves in a strange monotone language that he could not 
understand. still under hypnosis, he recalled that one of the beings floated him back to his car and 
he drove off to the beach with no conscious memory of the onboard segment. Now, finding out he was a 
contactee was very stressful for him. As he says, "For years, I didn't know what had happened. I 
never talked about it. I was worried about getting put into a mental institution." Now, here's 
another interesting case. June 4, 1972, three couples were returning from a late evening dinner 
in Wallingford when they saw a quote pear-shaped craft. They said it had a quote concave disc on 
the top and a red light on the bottom. And they watched it for about 15 minutes. All six witnesses 
were absolutely convinced that this object was not a plane or a balloon or anything conventional. So 
they decided to make a report to authorities. The third report was not taken seriously and officials 
just dismissed it, discounted it. Here's another case. 1976, an anonymous Wallingford resident was 
queried by a newspaper reporter writing a story about UFOs and asking whether he believed in 
UFOs. And the man answered that no, he did not. But he later learned that yes, UFOs are real 
because it was one year later in 1977, he was in the Ridgeland section of Wallingford when he 
saw a quote domed disc high in the northern sky and he watched it as it quote engaged in unusual 
wobbling, darting, looping and drifting motions. He said it quote glowed in a brilliant randomly 
pulsating white light with occasional bursts of prismatic color changing throughout its form. So 
this lasted a long time, a full 35 minutes. And this encounter marked the beginning, he says, 
of a series of contacts culminating in direct contact with extraterrestrial beings. Now, one 
Wallingford man who claims direct contact is John Bolinsky. He may or may not be the man described 
in the above case. I think he is. I think he finally came forward because he says that in 
1979 he had been repeatedly visited by grey type aliens who appeared regularly in his home to take 
him on board their craft to examine him and as he says take biological samples. He was inspired by 
his experience to investigate the subject and eventually became a state director for Mufon. 
And as he says, you've got to be a certain kind of person to handle it. I'll tell you one thing, 
my life will never be normal. So he says that he was regularly visited by these beings. He's 
given one of them the name Zatar and describes him as being very tall with a large head, pale skin, 
large dark shiny angled eyes, and four fingers on each hand. He actually made a sculpture of him as 
you can see. He has been told that more and more people will be visited and as he says they have 
always been around. They've been watching us for thousands of years. Now he himself is a pilot but 
he says that the technology achieved by the ETSs is far and advance of our own. As he says I have 
been shown a lot from them. If humans were able to understand it we could tap into the energy of 
the universe. Nick's case occurred on March 21st, 1985 when the switchboards at the police and fire 
stations lit up when more than three dozen people called to report a quote round thing in the sky. 
So, some officials were skeptical, including Martin Small, a supervisor at the control 
tower at Tweed. And he says that what others were reporting was probably ultraight aircraft, which 
seems at odds, honestly, from the descriptions provided by the majority of witnesses. Of course, 
other officials disagree with the ultralight explanation. An official at Bradley International 
Airport in Windsor Locks said that if they were ultral lights, they would not have been lit up 
as this object was. That ultral lights don't even usually fly at night. So, this sighting 
was actually during a massive UFO wave known as the Hudson Valley UFO wave, which struck primarily 
the upstate New York area, but also parts of Connecticut. It remains a controversial wave 
to this day and there has been a number of books on this particular wave of sightings. Two years 
later, there was another very similar sighting apparently still part of this wave. A musician 
and his friend were stepping out of his studio in Wallingford and looking up saw a quote large disc 
silently floating. Said it was directly over their heads at very low altitude, no higher than 1,000 
ft. And as he says, we watched it pass over us very slowly, maybe 20 m an hour. This is just a 
guess because once it passed, we decided to follow it. I followed it in my car for 20 minutes. When 
we got to Route 10, the craft had gained on us and went over a hill. So now that it was out of view, 
they just went ahead and performed their music gig in Camden. They shared their sighting with others, 
and they were dismissed as crazy. The next morning, several newspapers published a story 
that 13 people were flying ultralights to apparently hoax a UFO sighting. The musician 
disagrees vehemently with this theory. As he says, this was not the case. I was directly under the 
ship and I saw its shape. It was constant, no fluctuations. It was also completely silent. 
13 ultral lights would have sounded like 13 people were cutting their lawns above us. 
There was no sound. I knew this immediately was a cover story. Not a very good one. Now, 
I did find another amazing onboard experience in Wallingford. It was so cool that I am going to 
save it for another episode featuring only onboard encounters. Thank you, Linda Thomas. Definitely 
Wallingford delivered and I'm sorry that I didn't cover that last case of an onboard experience, 
but it was so interesting that I wanted to save it for an episode that's exclusively devoted to 
onboard UFO encounters. So, I hope to get that one out to you in over the next couple of weeks 
at least. But those cases are much harder to vet as well and they're not as numerous as sightings 
and you know cases of humanoids and this sort of thing. So I'll get to it, but thank you. That was 
really really interesting. So now let's get to our last and final location in this episode 14 
of UFOs in your hometown and that is Wkegan, Illinois. This one is really special to me 
because I grew up right in that area. I originally come from the Chicago area, Wakanda in Illinois, 
but this is right next door to it. I've been in this area before. Not super familiar with 
it because we did leave when I was quite a young kid, but yeah, it was really special. So, really 
want to thank you, Ricky Daniels, for suggesting this location of Walkagan, Illinois. Definitely 
found some good cases, about four, including a very unusual humanoid encounter. Sure, there are 
a lot more because there's about 90,000 people who live in this location. So, there's got to be 
thousands of sightings, but I think you'll find these particularly interesting. The first case 
I found in Walkegan is particularly compelling because it comes from a very credible witness, 
Dr. John Robinson, a hystopathologist at the Great Lakes Naval Medical Research Unit. He reported his 
case directly to the Air Techchnical Intelligence Command in Washington DC. And as he writes, 
"On September 6, 1950, I was at Edison Court, Wkegan, Illinois, about 5:40 to 5:50 p.m. The 
day was perfectly clear, no clouds in the sky with a slight south wind blowing. I saw an object in 
the sky over the northern part of Walkegan which I have not been able to identify. It was sausage 
shaped measuring 80 ft in diameter and perhaps 15 to 20 ft in center thickness. When first seen 
was possibly 5,000 to 7,000 ft north at a 75° angle. Was nearly stationary but had a motion 
of rotation end over end about a central axis. The object was clearly visible, was entirely silent. 
The outer or convex part was of a silvery color with a peculiar light appearance different from 
sun reflection and suggestive of luminescence. The concave or underside was of a light gray color. My 
first thought was that it must be a peculiar large balloon-like object, but I wondered at 
its large size, constant speed of rotation, and strangely bright appearance. It hovered in nearly 
one location for about 2 to three minutes and then abruptly traveled westward very rapidly towards 
the airport with a speed I would judge to be that of jet planes occasionally seen here. It continued 
to be perfectly silent and also maintained its continual slow rotation about its central axis. 
When it reached a position 2 to three miles south of Waggan airport, it again slowed down and became 
nearly motionless. At this point, a friend of mine arrived, and I pointed this object out to him, 
which was equally puzzling to him. After remaining rather localized for a few minutes, 
it again began a very fast westerly movement, and in a few seconds rapidly passed beyond sight. When 
last seen, it had a remarkably fast speed, which might have been several hundred miles hour, faster 
than any aircraft I have seen. Now, as illustrated by confidential documents from the US Air Force 
intelligence, declassified 35 years after the sighting, the military intelligence officers took 
great interest in this sighting. Another very interesting case occurred around 3:00 a.m. on 
March 27, 1958. Paul J. Tarion of 918 Glenn Flora Avenue was driving north on Route 42A just south 
of Route 120 in Walk Keegan when he saw a flash of amber light appear in front of him right in the 
path of his automobile. As the light flashed out, the motor on his car mysteriously died. He coasted 
almost a block before his engine finally restarted and he said he was quote all shook up. In fact, 
he immediately pulled over at a nearby tavern and alerted the police. The police retraced his route, 
but did not see anything unusual. Another really interesting case occurred on March 23rd, 1981, 
when Nancy Bryson, age 41, and her friend and roommate Myrtle Fulture of 3216 Gideon 
Avenue were driving south on Lewis Avenue at 8:45 a.m. This is less than one mile from their home. 
And this is when they noticed five very bright, large red lights flying at a very low elevation, 
treetop level, right over the intersection of 33rd Street and Galilee Avenue, which you 
can see here. So, they were so struck by this, they called the police to report their sighting, 
telling them that the lights were quote too big and bright to be airplanes. They weren't flashing 
on and off as airplane lights do. So, while the police did take the report, they neglected to do 
any investigation. Final interesting Walkagan case involves what appears to be direct face-to-face 
contact with some kind of reptilian entity. The anonymous witness says that about 3:15 a.m. on 
November 10, 2011, after sending out repeated mental messages for direct alien contact, 
he was taking out the trash and throwing it in the apartment's dumpster when he saw, I quote, 
a black hole getting larger in size. This was directly in front of him. He immediately realized 
that his request for direct contact was about to be fulfilled. So he forced himself to remain calm 
while keeping up his mental guard to protect his sanity is how he put it. And as the witness says, 
it looked like a bipeedal being with arms and a humanoid form. Its skin was dark. It insisted on 
standing in the shade out of the security lights from the apartment building where I resided. It 
may have had a scaly or reptilian appearance of skin, hands, and feet. I could not remember if 
it had a tail. It was in the darkest zone of my parking lot and landscaped. It could have claws 
on the ends of its fingers, but I stood further back as I was beginning to frighten myself, 
for its intentions were unknown to me. Now, the witness was interested in these kinds of things. 
He was familiar with David Ike's research into reptilians, and he realized at this point that he 
was probably encountering one. And being alone, he got scared and realized that he might not be brave 
enough for such an encounter. So he retreated back towards the door of his apartment. And he says at 
this point that the entity quote moved in a way that a feline would after its prey. So he rushed 
back into his apartment and just meditated to calm down and not long after that moved out of that 
apartment to another building. Pretty interesting case of what appears to be a close encounter of 
the fifth kind and also a close encounter of the third kind. a direct contact with a 
humanoid. Thank you very much, Ricky Daniels, for suggesting Wkegan, Illinois. That was particularly 
interesting to me having grown up in that area. But again, this just proves my point that UFOs 
are being seen everywhere. Again, this series of episodes was born from a challenge. Name any town, 
any city, any location on this planet, and I will find a UFO encounter there. And I'm still betting 
100%. I know there's a bunch of you out there who are waiting very patiently for your hometown to be 
covered. And please be patient. I will get there. It's taking me a long time cuz some of these place 
names are quite common and I have to go through thousands upon thousands of documents to try to 
get this information. But the implications of this are really profound. Why are UFOs being 
seen everywhere on this planet? I think what this shows is a couple of things. One, that UFOs are 
far far more common than people realize in terms of UFO sightings and encounters. If they're being 
seen everywhere, just think how many cases there actually are. Again, this is just the tip of the 
iceberg with most people not even reporting their encounters, there must be millions upon millions, 
100 million encounters at least. I don't know. Oh, it wouldn't surprise me if it numbers in 
the billion. Actually, another really interesting takeaway I think from the fact that these UFOs are 
being seen everywhere is that it looks like these ETs, and I do think that's what we're dealing with 
here, are putting on what amounts to a publicity campaign, a very carefully orchestrated publicity 
campaign, much in the manner of perhaps a musician going from city to city to play their music and 
get it well known, or an author on a book tour or something along those lines. So I think this 
shows one of the ET agendas which is simply to announce their presence. So that are the two 
main takeaways I think from these from this series of episodes that I'm doing UFOs in your hometown 
episode 14. Going to get to episode 15 as soon as I can. I've been trying to do one per month, 
but this one was a long time in coming cuz it's getting hard. Again, these take me probably three 
or four times the amount of work compared to a normal episode. So again, please be patient. 
If you'd like to suggest another location, I'm perfectly happy to put it on my list. Just as long 
as you recognize that my list is now just under 1,000 locations, so I'll get to it when I can. 
Thank you guys so much. I hope you've enjoyed this episode, perhaps learned a little bit. I truly 
appreciate you guys watching. I think this is such an important subject. We all deserve to know the 
truth. It's time for this cover up to end. And each of these cases has something to teach us 
about life beyond Earth. And what could be more interesting than that? So, thank you, thank you, 
thank you. I truly appreciate it. I'll see you next week. And until then, keep asking those hard 
questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun. Bye for now.
