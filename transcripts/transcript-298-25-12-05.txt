ALIEN RESCUE: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS OF PATRICIA CATES
Dec 5, 2025


Summary:
Dec 5, 2025 (0:49:15) The Light Gate Podcast with Preston Dennett & Dolly Safran
Patricia Cates (a waitress) has experienced a lifetime of high strangeness involving UFO sightings, 
missing time, face-to-face experiences with humanoids and several fully conscious onboard UFO 
encounters. Along with these are a wide variety of paranormal events including precognition, spirit 
communication, out of body experiences and more. Her case is one of the most unusual on record, and 
it provides an important contribution to our understanding of extraterrestrial contact. This video 
presents her story.

Born in 1943 in Key West, Florida, her first encounter occurred around age four when she saw a gray 
alien staring at her through the window of her second-story bedroom. She had never heard of gray 
aliens and had no idea what she was looking at. But this was just the beginning. Her childhood was 
filled with strange events. She experienced an amazing connection with animals from a very young 
age. She was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness which miraculously disappeared, baffling 
doctors. And she had a missing time encounter which, at the time, she had no way to understand.

As she grew up, she continued to experience numerous missing time encounters but had no idea what 
was causing them. She certainly didn’t think it had anything to do with UFOs. As she says, “If you 
had told me back then that there were aliens and UFOs. I would have thought you were crazy.”
She soon began to have regular premonitions and precognitive dreams. She heard a voice which accurately predicted the death of President Eisenhower. She had a dream that a plane would crash on a street in downtown Miami. Less than a week later, it happened exactly as she had seen. She was able to predict other disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and more. During her job as a cocktail waitress, she astounded customers with her uncanny psychic ability. On a few occasions, she had premonitions which saved her life.

One day she heard a voice instructing her to attend a psychic class. By pure synchronicity, she saw an advertisement about this and attended the class. This changed her life and offered her the opportunity to develop her already powerful psychic abilities. She began having direct spirit communication, past-life recall and regular out-of-body experiences. One night, after returning to her home from this class, she had a bizarre encounter with two grays who were waiting in her living room and had a very personal message for her.

Later she moved to Colfax, Louisiana, and there she had a series of close-up UFO sightings. Then in 1985, she had her first fully conscious onboard UFO encounter. She woke up to find herself standing next to a human-looking ET in a rural area overlooking a large village that looked to her to be a village in South America. A short distance away was a massive craft, with grays and human-looking ETs standing beneath it. Patricia had the impression that a large-scale disaster was about to occur. To her amazement, she and the ET traveled into the village and began to bring people onboard. They spent most of the night doing this, collecting hundreds (if not thousands) of people, just in time before a major disaster struck. She was taken onboard and allowed to explore the craft. The next thing she knew, she was being dropped off back at her home in Louisiana.

Waking up the next morning, she wondered if it might have all been just a crazy dream. But turning on the TV, she saw her “dream” was real, as a large disaster involving massive loss of life was garnering international headlines. The shock of this was so intense, she sought therapy. The therapy was helpful, but she soon stopped because the therapist was so impressed by her psychic abilities that he was more interested in that than helping her.

Just a few years later, she had another vivid premonition of a disaster. It was a pattern that would repeat throughout her entire life. Meanwhile, she continued to have more onboard encounters. After developing pneumonia, doctors suspected she had lung cancer. Pat found herself being taken onboard and healed by gray aliens. During another onboard encounter, she aliens showed her a vision of how Earth would look if all the water on the planet dried up. Another fascinating encounter involved a display where the ETs demonstrated how they are able to travel long distances without the use of any fuel as we know it. Further encounters were so bizarre that she hesitated to share them but ultimately decided that the truth was more important.

Patricia Cates extraterrestrial encounters and paranormal experiences have volumes to teach us about the ET agenda on our planet. While some of her encounters have been scary and traumatizing, she ultimately feels that they were benevolent and that the ETs not only cared about her, but all of humanity.

Dec 5, 2025
Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs 
in the Paranormal. I have a very special episode for you today. It's all about one woman's lifelong 
experiences with extraterrestrials. I call this episode Alien Rescue the onboard UFO encounters of 
Patricia Kates. Patricia reached out to me. She's had so many experiences. She really wanted someone 
to talk to about it. She was getting older and really wanted to share her story before it became 
too late. Her encounters began at a very young age and involved the full range of UFO encounters, 
including of course sightings, but face-to-face encounters with humanoids, missing time, 
and quite a few fully conscious onboard UFO encounters. She has not used hypnosis. I've 
talked to quite a few people and she is just a one of a handful of people who have what I call 
fully conscious UFO encounters. Though it did take her some time to reach that point. She's 
also had a lot of really unusual and powerful paranormal experiences, which of course is 
more the rule than the exception when it comes to UFO contacties. but she's a terrific lady, 
very intelligent, has a wonderful sense of humor, and I'm just so honored that she reached out to 
me to share her case. So, that's what I'd like to talk about with you today. Her case, I think, 
is typical in some ways, but also has some very unusual elements that I honestly haven't heard 
before or since. I think it's an important case, and I'm just really excited to share it with you 
today. Now, like most contacties, her experiences began in very early childhood. So, I'm going to 
start her story with childhood experiences, which include face-to-face contact with ETSs, 
some really amazing experiences with animals, uh, missing time, and actually what appears to 
be a healing event. So, I call this first segment I thought it came from the circus. That's a direct 
quote from Patricia. It's really interesting because often people will have an encounter. 
They really go through what Jay Allen Heinik calls theory escalation trying to figure out what 
they're seeing because it's literally completely alien to their worldview. Now, Patricia Kates was 
born in 1943 and grew up in Key West, Florida. And one day when she was about four, maybe five years 
old, her grandparents took her to the circus. This was an event that she enjoyed immensely. But that 
night while she was staying with her grandparents, she went to bed in a second story bedroom. And 
looking out the window as she was falling asleep, she was shocked to see a pale gray-skinned being 
bald with large dark eyes staring at her from outside. As Pat says, I saw a gray. I thought 
something followed us home from the circus. It was watching me. No communication, just watching me. 
Now, of course, at the time, she did not know it was a gray alien. In hindsight, she figured out 
that that's what she was looking at. But she really had no idea. And after it disappeared, 
she ran downstairs and told her grandparents. They immediately took her back upstairs and 
pointed out that this was a twostory house and that she was on the second floor and that 
there was no way she could have seen anybody and that it must have been her imagination. So yeah, 
now in hindsight Pat realizes what happened. But back then with no reference for what she had seen, 
she didn't know what to think. The only thing she knew for sure was that she hadn't imagined it. 
Now, the next incident that was really unusual, I call the mouse. Like many contacties, Pat reports 
an amazing connection to animals. And when she was just a little girl, she was outside one afternoon 
and saw this tiny little mouse hiding under the neighbor's house. I'll just let Pat describe what 
happened next. As she says, "So, I put my hand out and I made it come to me and get in my hand. 
I told it I wouldn't hurt it. You know, like they tell us, "I won't hurt you. I'll put you back." 
He came and got in my hand. Swear on the Bible. I took it home and put it in an 8 cup measuring cup 
that my mom let me have that was glass. And she said, "Don't break it." And I put some cheese in 
it. And I carried this sucker around for an hour or two and it wasn't happy. So, I took it back. 
And I was putting it back under the lady's house when she said, "What are you doing under my house? 
and I said, "I'm putting your mouse back." Well, she went ballistic on me over the mouse thing, 
and I thought I got caught because I wasn't supposed to make things come to me and I didn't 
do that again. An amazing event in one of many unusual animal stories that Patricia has had. 
And here's another one, which I call a miraculous healing. Quite a few contacties report healings, 
and Pat had one when she was very young. It was about one year after this mouse incident at age 
six that Pat started to feel weak and ill. So her mother took her to the doctor. The diagnosis was 
devastating. Pat, the doctor said, had leukemia. Now the worst part for Pat were all the needles 
and constant blood tests. She hated it naturally. But strangely, right when she was about to begin 
treatment, the leukemia spontaneously disappeared. The doctors were totally unable to account for 
this because Pat had been very sick and all the tests were positive for leukemia. But three weeks 
later, she was perfectly healthy. Now, Pat's family assumed that there must have been some 
sort of miraculous healing, nobody could explain it. And now that Pat was well again. Nothing more 
was really thought about it. But again, looking back in hindsight, Pat wonders if perhaps the ETSs 
had a hand in her healing because she would later experience some incredible healing events from 
them. Now, moving along, she also had an incident involving missing time. It was just a few years 
later when Pat was about seven or eight years old, and she was playing in the woods across the street 
from her home. This is something she had done many times. But on this particular occasion, something 
very strange happened to her. As Pat says, all I remember is everything lit up. The woods lighting 
up. It was a couple of hours later I went home. I didn't know what happened to me. I thought 
I had seen God or something. Again, she really had no way to interpret this. She had no idea. 
Only again in hindsight did she realize, oh my gosh, you know, I had missing time. There was this 
bright white light. It shows all the signs that this was probably a missing time event and could 
very well have been an onboard encounter, though she has no memory of this. Again, as we see, 
UFO contact begins at a very early age. So, here's Patricia already having quite a few very unusual 
experiences, seeing ETs, having missing time, this absolutely amazing connection with animals, 
something almost all contactes report. Now, at this point, she's still not entirely sure what's 
going on. She know there's something strange going on, but she's not connecting the dots to herself 
being a UFO contacteee. So this was just the beginning for her. As she grew up into an adult, 
she's continued to have all kinds of really odd experiences. So I call this next segment the 
high strangeness continues because absolutely in Patricia's case the experiences were quite 
numerous and very much unexplained. I call this next segment missing time. And again, 
this is something most contactees will experience at one time or another. And it was certainly true 
for Pat, not only in her childhood, but as she grew up into an adult. Before long, Pat was out of 
school and out on her own. And she began working as a cocktail waitress at the Miami Hilton Hotel. 
She also had aspirations of becoming an actress. So, she and another friend, also a hopeful actor, 
would often go out on auditions together. or other times would just go out to eat and socialize. And 
it was during these trips together that they began having this problem with missing time 
over and over again. As Pat says, I used to get off work and I would go pick her up and we would 
go to Orlando and we would never get there. We'd wake up on the side of the road. We had 
gone to sleep and woke up in the car and never got anywhere. That used to happen quite regularly, a 
halfozen times. We kept saying, "We're not having any fun." Now, at the time, the idea of missing 
time was a completely foreign concept to her. She had no idea what it could mean. And despite her 
childhood encounters, she was still not connecting the missing time incidents to UFOs. As Pat says, 
"If you had told me back then that there were aliens and UFOs, I would have thought you were 
crazy." Now, like many contactees, Patricia also has had a lot of psychic experiences. And I call 
this next segment Patricia's predictions. She had quite a few predictions of future events. 
This happened over and over again. For example, on March 28, 1969, President Eisenhower passed away 
from congestive heart failure. Years earlier, he had suffered a series of heart attacks. And it was 
shortly after this that Pat was listening to the radio and heard the tragic news. Suddenly, a voice 
came into her head telling her that Eisenhower would remain alive for six more months. And this, 
of course, turned out to be a prediction that was true. Now, this same voice also told her that when 
she heard about an occult class being taught in Miami, she was to sign up for the class. This was 
not something she was thinking about. She didn't even know about it. But one week later, Pat was 
driving to work when she heard an advertisement about this class on the radio. And remembering 
what the voice had told her, she decided to sign up. And to her surprise, this class opened up a 
whole new world for her. Another incident in mid June of 1969. Pat's now 26 years old. She had this 
very vivid dream that a plane was going to crash on 36th Street in downtown Miami. In fact, in the 
dream, she was actually in the cockpit with the pilot and co-pilot and watched the whole accident 
happen. As she says, "I watched it as it blew up." Now, again, at the time of this incident, 
she was still working as a cocktail waitress at the Miami Holiday Inn, and she mentioned 
this event to her co-workers and actually warned them to not go anywhere near 36th Street. But, 
as Pat says, they teased the crap out of me. and then a plane crashed on 36th Street. This accident 
happened on June 23rd, 1969. You can see the photos here of this devastating accident. It was 
a DC4 cargo plane and 11 people perished in this accident. It was a big deal. Another prediction 
that she had, she warned her friends about a hurricane hitting the Carolas. And sure enough, 
it did. On another occasion, she warned about an earthquake coming to Miami, and two weeks later, 
it happened. So, by this time, Pat was beginning to get used to all these psychic events. Another 
major one happened one evening while working at the hotel bar. A man came in and sat down. 
At that time, Pat was looking through a deck of tarot cards that somebody had given her, 
and the man saw her and asked her, "Why don't you read my fortune?" And Pat told him, 
"I don't know how to use tarot cards." But as she said that, suddenly the name Margaret popped 
very clearly into her head. So she turned to the man and said, "Who's Margaret?" The man looked 
surprised and said, "That's my wife." Immediately, more images flooded into Patricia's mind's eye, 
and she told the man, "You've got two little boys." One of them fell off a stonewall and 
hurt his knee, but he wasn't hurt bad. Now, the man confirmed this and he was impressed. So, 
he decided to test her ability and asked her what he had just received in the mail. And Pat replied, 
"Boxes and boxes of paper from somebody named Martin." She had no idea what this meant. She 
was simply relaying the information that popped into her mind. But again, the man was impressed 
and said, "Martin's my boss." and he explained that he worked at Eastern Airlines and at the time 
they were installing computers which involved a lot of paperwork and he had in fact just received 
these boxes. So there was a lot of occasions like this. Another one involved a man who had come to 
the bar and there was this ghost standing behind him. Pat could see it clearly just like a living 
person and it was his aunt and she wanted to relay a message. And before P could stop herself, 
she began to berate the man for stealing his aunt's inheritance and then described his aunt 
in detail. This freaked the man out naturally and he fled the bar. Another weird event occurred one 
evening that had a dream that a crazy lady stabbed her in the back with a pair of scissors. The next 
day, she was driving to work. She stopped at an intersection when suddenly somebody hopped into 
the backseat of her car and to her dismay was the same crazy lady from her dream. The lady asked Pat 
to drive her to the bus station. So Pat decided to do this being very careful. She then dropped this 
lady off and immediately called the police who apprehended the woman. And she learned that this 
woman was an escaped inmate who was in fact armed with a pair of scissors. It was just one event 
after another like this. One day she was driving home and a voice yelled, "Stop." At that moment, 
a vehicle ran the stop sign of the intersection moving at high speed. She had a lot of weird 
coincidences and synchronicities. For example, one time she got on an airplane and who should 
be sitting next to her? None other than the abduction investigator, Bud Hopkins. She had this 
weird penchant for running into famous people. She met Anthony Quinn, Milton Burl, and several 
others. So, there are all kinds of these weird psychic events and synchronicities happening to 
her constantly. As you can see, synchronicity is playing a big part in Patricia's life experiences. 
And we see that a lot with contactees. These incredible synchronicities happen. And of course, 
psychic abilities. Again, that's more the norm than the exception. Almost all contactes have a 
wide variety of paranormal experiences and that's certainly true with Patricia. Now I call this next 
segment more encounters, more strange experiences because as we will see contact is more than just 
being taken on board and physically examined. There's a lot of high stranges involved. That's 
absolutely true in Patricia's case, especially with this next event. One of Patricia's weirdest 
contacts I call the gray alien in the pinstriped suit. One evening while taking the psychic occult 
class which was scheduled during night hours she finished the class and came home at a late hour 
and as she went inside her home she was surprised to see two small beings. Each had round eyes, 
a small mouth and a nose and a big elongated skull. They were typical grays. As Pat says, they 
couldn't pass for human. One was light colored and the other was a lighter gray or tan. And if I tell 
you what it was dressed in, you're going to think I'm crazy. It was dressed in a roaring 20s kind of 
zoot suit. It was trying not to scare me. I looked at it at the outfit. I knew it was projecting what 
it was wearing because it was trying not to scare me. And although this tactic was bizarre, she 
says it worked like a charm. As Pat says, I wasn't scared of it. And it asked me to do a favor. Swear 
to God, it said when I went to the class next week, it told me to tell the teacher that I had 
seen it. So Pat called this being Mr. Button Nose. It was a nickname. She gave it this nickname due 
to its appearance. So when she went to class next week, she told the teacher. To her disappointment, 
he reacted in a kind of nonchalant way, saying that yes, he knew about these beings, but didn't 
say anything further about it. Pat loved this class. It changed her life. She made some great 
friends in this class, and for the first time, she felt like she had found a group that she fit in. 
It was during this time that she had a series of past life dreams. She remembered being a 
servant in one life, which ended in an accidental drowning. In another lifetime, she was a Chinese 
soldier who died in a war. She remembered several lifetimes as priests and nuns. So, 
this past life recall became another weird part of the paranormal events she was experiencing. 
She also learned about out-of- body experiences or astral travel which she began experiencing. There 
was a whole period of time during which she had repetitive astral projection experiences, obbees, 
where she was taken to what looked like a temple similar in construction to Grecian architecture. 
And while she was there, she would be taught on a variety of subjects. Later, Pat moved with another 
friend to central Louisiana, finally settling on the shores of Lake Eat near Grant Parish. And on 
several occasions while she lived there, she and her friend repeatedly saw strange lights over this 
lake. So another whole period of her life involved repetitive UFO sightings. How amazing is that? I'm 
particularly intrigued by the time Patricia came home and saw one of these gray ETs dressed up in 
a pinstriped suit. She's certainly not the only person who has told me about events like this. 
There's all kinds of costumes ETSs sometimes put on which as Patricia thought I also think 
is to sort of reduce the fear factor or maybe it's a form of ET humor. I don't know. Whitley 
Strieber also reported this. Also the constant UFO sightings that's absolutely something that 
the vast majority of UFO contacties experience. But now I want to talk about Patricia's main UFO 
encounter, the one that really impressed her the most. It's so unusual, and this I call the alien 
rescue. She was a participant in a very unusual event that apparently saved the lives of thousands 
of people. There are many cases like this of ETSs healing people and rescuing them, but I've 
never heard of an event on this massive of a scale before. I think you'll find it absolutely amazing. 
Pat's next experience was absolutely astonishing. I call it ETS save the lives of thousands after a 
volcanic eruption. Was on the evening of November 13, 1985 that Pat went to bed early. She had only 
been asleep a short while when she suddenly woke up, and to her surprise, she was no longer in bed. 
Instead, she was absolutely shocked to see that she was now wide awake, strangely calm, 
and standing on this flat area, looking down at a steep incline at what appeared to be a town 
or village of several thousand people. It looked like it was daytime, perhaps early morning. She 
couldn't really tell. The village, however, was filled with brightly painted stores and shops and 
homes, and it was just a few hundred yards away from her, divided by a very small river. As Pat 
says, I was looking down at a small city. I didn't know where I was, but I knew it wasn't the United 
States. I was waiting for somebody. I didn't know who I was waiting for, but I was looking down at 
this city. Now, the area around it looked lush and tropical, and it kind of reminded her of Mexico or 
somewhere in South America. Suddenly, she noticed this messo Americanlooking man about 5 1/2 ft 
tall with tightly curled black hair, dark skin approaching her from behind. And turning around, 
she saw this gigantic circular metallic craft. As Pat says, it was a couple of ridges from me. 
It had a big 100 foot wide ramp going down on the left side and was really bright. She immediately 
noticed several other humanlooking beings and some tall skinny grays. They were all walking around 
the base of the ship apparently making sure that the ground was stable. That was her impression. 
Now the short dark-skinned man who was next to her, Pat now believes he was probably an ET. He 
began to lead her down the mountain and into this village. It was just a short distance. And somehow 
Pat was made to understand that she and this man were on a mission to retrieve certain people from 
this village. As Pat says, some kind of disaster was ready to happen. But I didn't know what it 
was. We went down across the little stream to this store. We went up the stairs on the side and woke 
the people up. A man and a woman. They had a brand new baby, a few weeks old, and another child about 
three. and we took them with us. And then we went about getting other people and bringing them back 
to this UFO. We gathered many people and they were filling the bottom area of the UFO with 
people that they wanted from this city. I was in the lower part of this thing. It had about a 16 ft 
column that ran up the middle of it and a white railing around it and they were putting them in 
that lower area. So per Pat, they made several trips till this object was almost filled with 
people. As Pat says, they picked up anybody they could or anybody who would follow us up there and 
put them in the bottom couple of decks. It had a lot of different decks and we packed these people 
in. After doing this, Pat was then taken to the upper level of the craft. She now saw that there 
was another craft further upstream. She said the lower level was so bright that it kind of hurt 
her eyes, but the upper level had a more pleasing illumination. As she says, it was lit in a soft 
pink light that didn't hurt your eyes. There was a curving kind of a wall that had a bank of all red 
lights. It looked like square boxes built into it where they could touch places on it. The crew on 
this thing looked just like us, except they were wearing blue jumpsuits. Pat estimates that there 
were about 30 ETs, both humanlooking and grays, aboard the craft. All the human-looking ETs wore 
blue jumpsuits. Interestingly, she noticed that they were of different ethnicities, white, black, 
Asian, and more. Now, these two craft stayed there waiting for this mysterious disaster to occur when 
suddenly there was this huge volcanic explosion. And shortly later, a huge flow of mud, rock, ice, 
trees, debris, and dead bodies came hurtling down this riverbed. To Pat's amazement, the UFOs lifted 
up and hovered above this horrendous disaster scene and then came slowly down in a falling leaf 
motion and began scooping people up from the mud flows and into the craft. As Pat says, when that 
first wave came, it the craft came back down. It changed the shape of the metal on the outside of 
this thing so that people who made it there could actually hold onto it. It changed its outside 
metal configuration into a railing kind of thing and a flat area where people could climb on. They 
collected these people. There were three waves, the first one being the worst. There was nothing 
left after that first one except some people that had made it to higher land. So these UFOs picked 
up people both before, during, and after this volcanic disaster. Following the initial landing 
and wave of mud, the object came down twice, rescuing as many people as it could. The second 
time, saving people from the active mud flows, and the third time picking up only a few remaining 
survivors who had made it to higher ground. Now, Pat has no idea why the ETSs brought her there 
or why she was so docel and obedient. The people who were being rescued were also very obedient, 
following Pat and the ETs without question. Was clear to her that for some reason she had been 
chosen to help rescue people from the volcano. As Pat says, they followed us back like sheep. Nobody 
put up an argument. They picked up thousands of people between the two of the UFOs. At some 
point during the experience, Pat was exploring the interior of this craft and wandered over to 
this central column. He saw a small concavity in the column and reached out to touch it. And as Pat 
says, when I did touch it, it shocked the crap out of me. She was immediately approached by one of 
the ETs, a black woman, who told her to go ahead and touch it again. Pat refused and the woman 
insisted and Pat told her, "It's not my job and if it's not my job, I'm not going to do it." So 
this woman finally stopped pestering her. The last thing Pat remembers is being escorted off a little 
twopersonsized craft by one of the beings in the blue jumpsuits, a gray. And as the ramp opened and 
she began to walk out, this tall gray asked her, "Do you know what your gift is?" Pat had no idea 
what he was talking about and feeling stupid because she didn't know, she said flippantly, 
"If you're so smart, why don't you tell me?" The being did not reply. She felt if she had 
not been such a smart mouth, the being might have answered a question, but she did have the distinct 
impression that it was amused. As she says, "I don't know how to explain that. It didn't smile, 
but I think inside it was laughing at me." The next thing Pat knew, it was the next morning. 
And upon awakening, she instantly recalled what had happened. And it was another of what she 
calls her UFO dreams. Of course, she knows these were more than just dreams, but that's kind of 
how she dealt with it. But in this case, she would soon have proof that it wasn't a dream. It wasn't 
long before this that she got confirmation. That morning she called and told her best friend about 
this incredible quote UFO dream and her friend was confused and asked her, "What do you mean again?" 
So Pat was also confused by this response and asked her, "What do you mean?" And her 
friend explained that Pat had actually called her yesterday morning reporting the same exact dream. 
And didn't she remember this? And why was she repeating herself? Pat had no memory of this at 
all. She only remembered the one dream from that morning, but her friend says, "It doesn't matter. 
Hang up the phone. Go and turn on the news." So Pat did. She went to the television and turned it 
on. And it was to be one of the biggest shocks of her life. In fact, several of the channels on the 
TV were covering the same story. The Nevada Del Ruiz volcano in Colombia, South America had just 
erupted, completely obliterating entire villages over a very wide area, covering them in feet of 
mud and killing an estimated 23,000 people. The village Pat had seen was called Arrow and 
was in the direct path of the volcanic flows. In fact, 85% of the town was buried. 200,000 
people were made homeless. And this remains one of the top four deadliest volcanic eruptions in 
world history. Seeing this was very stressful for Pat. She actually burst into tears because 
as she watched this footage, she recognized the area and the disaster scene. She had been there. 
Her UFO dream wasn't a dream at all. Clearly, it had really happened. and she was very curious what 
had happened to all these people cuz it was clear that they could not have been returned to Earth. 
As Pat says, it truly upset me. It was horrid. This wall of human beings, houses, dead animals, 
huge chunks of ice, bigger than a house. I never wanted to look. It really disturbed me. All those 
dead people was horrible. Terrible. So much death. All of this came down and took those cities right 
off the planet. And they the ETs took thousands of people and they weren't bringing them back. 
And who would miss them? So yeah, this was so stressful for Pat that this began a search for 
help. She was in shock. She was so shaken up that she ended up going to a therapist. And she 
spoke with him for some time before revealing the source of her anxiety, this experience. 
And to her surprise, the man explained that he had worked as a psychiatrist for the Pentagon 
for his entire career and that he had heard many similar stories of UFOs. She got along 
really well with the therapist and the visits were definitely beneficial to her. But before long, 
it became clear to her that he was actually benefiting more from their visits than she 
was because he had this BOF feedback machine in his office. And she repeatedly impressed him 
with her ability to make the readout go down to five or lower or sometimes even zero. So he was 
testing her constantly and asked her, "How do you do that?" And she replied, "I don't know." So, he 
was really much more interested in her abilities than in helping her at some point. Another time, 
she had an out-of- body experience and she found herself at this therapist's home. The therapist's 
wife was screaming in pain. So, Pat woke up and even though it was only 500 a.m., she called him 
up and told him, "You need to take your wife to the hospital." And he answered the phone and said, 
"Oh, Pat." not even questioning how she knew this, "Hang up the phone. We're on our way." During 
another session, the doctor asked her to read his aura, which she did. On another visit, she 
informed her doctor that his office manager and her son, who he had just hired, were embezzling 
funds from his company, and she told him it was about 30,000 so far. At her next appointment, her 
therapist revealed that, of course, she was right. He had just fired them both. And it was during one 
of their last meetings that he admitted his own belief in UFOs and the paranormal and that he said 
in his work for the Pentagon such subjects often came up. So Pat stopped visiting the therapist at 
this point, but she continued to have all kinds of precognition and more predictions of disaster. 
More psychic events continued. For example, on July 16, 1987, Pat had a very vivid dream about 
a bus filled with school children plunging into a river. The next day, the Guadalupe River in Texas 
experienced a flash flood. A school bus filled with children plunged into the river. Tragically, 
10 of the children perished in this accident. As you can imagine, this really freaked her out and 
it really made her question why all these events were happening to her. As Pat says, why do I wind 
up at disaster sites? It's like my job. I don't know. These things happen all my life. It's like 
something has always taken care of me my whole life. When something bad was going to happen, 
I would be removed from wherever I was at. I would be removed from the situation. something would 
happen where I had to go somewhere or I couldn't go that day. I was always kind of not present for 
some reason. By now, of course, Patricia was fully aware that she was the UFO contactee. And yeah, 
her experiences have been largely beneficial, but as you can see, also quite stressful. That event, 
being involved in the rescue, was a really good event, but it was extremely stressful for her and 
really caused her all kinds of emotional problems dealing with seeing all these people perish and 
apparently be rescued as well. I mean, it was a big deal for her and really was the 
motivation for her to start seeking information and help with this subject. And I'm glad she got 
confirmation that this was a real event. But even that brought more stress. And I think like many 
contactes and frankly anyone who has predictions and precognitions, that's another added level of 
stress. And she has a lot of questions about that. All I can say is that this is normal for 
contacties. Precognition, seeing ghosts, recalling past lives, all of this stuff is part and parcel 
of the UFO experience. So, I call this next segment Patricia's Secret Life because yes, 
she was now fully aware that she was a UFO contactee. And like most contactes, this is an 
ongoing thing. This becomes a part of their life, a normal part of their life. and she continued to 
have some really profound onboard experiences. One of Pat's most amazing encounters is when she was 
healed by the aliens. It was an encounter which she remembered almost entirely. She had come down 
with pneumonia and it worsened to the point where she was laboring for each breath. Pat did have a 
dread fear of hospitals and really didn't want to seek medical treatment. But finally realizing her 
life was in danger, she went to see the doctor and she was diagnosed with Legionnaire's pneumonia and 
the doctor gave her penicellin. The doctors were surprised that she was still alive. Her 
condition was that serious and they told her, "You should be dead." So they gave her this penicellin, 
but her condition wasn't improving. So she was put in the hospital and given an IV. They gave 
her a battery of blood tests and X-rays. And after a short stay in the hospital, 
she was sent home to continue her recovery. The hospital called her shortly later and said that 
the hilim of her lungs were enlarged and they suspected that she actually had lung cancer. They 
really wanted her to return for further tests, antibiopsy, and possibly surgery. Needless to say, 
Pat was extremely upset, and of course, she didn't want to have any surgery. But it was about one 
week later when the grays arrived. and his pet says, "I woke up floating out of bed with them." 
She immediately found herself lying on a table in a round room with a very bright light. The 
ETs told her telepathically, "Don't be scared. We're not going to hurt you." And as Pat says, 
they always say that and they never have. So, I opened my eyes and I'm lying on a table. There's 
a light hurting my eyes. She could see that there were six grays surrounding the table, 
three on each side. and one of them spoke to her telepathically saying, "The problem is 
in your right lung. It is potentially serious and we're going to fix it." Now, Pat felt immediately 
concerned. She thought to herself, "This isn't even a hospital. How sanitary could it be?" So, 
she just closed her eyes and tried to relax. She opened her eyes and the being told her to breathe 
in. And as Pat says, "So I took in a breath and it was like being in a swimming pool and sucking 
up a whole bunch of water up to my nose and I went ballistic." And she sent out a telepathic 
message to them, "You didn't fix anything. You're hurting me." And one of the tall grays said, 
"Be quiet. That's enough out of you." And the next thing Pat knew, it was mourning. Her best friend, 
who knew of her condition, insisted that Pat go to the hospital and at least get an X-ray. So Pat 
agreed and as she says, I went in there and it was gone. Nothing was there. Pat was incredibly 
relieved. And of course, she now believes the ETSs cured her. As Pat says, these beings are very tall 
and skinny. long fingers, little tiny nose, little wannabe mouths, long necks, really light skin. 
They're not frightening to me. I'm not scared of them. I have never been scared of them. So, 
that was one of several healing events, actually, and wasn't long before she had more onboard 
experiences. The majority of Pat's encounters have been very positive and benevolent, though she does 
admit that some of them have been frightening. During one of her encounters in her mid4s, she was 
taken on board to an observation deck looking down on the Earth from an extremely high altitude. Pat, 
who suffers from an intense fear of heights, was not happy about this. As Pat says, I do not like 
heights. We were standing on an observation deck, and I was about to puke and [ __ ] at the same 
time. There was a gray on each side of me, but I couldn't turn my head and look. I couldn't move. 
All I could do was look straight ahead and down at what they were showing me. But they were showing 
me the Earth with no water left on it. It was like a coming preview of this planet. I don't know how 
we could get rid of all the water. On another occasion, Pat found herself on board a craft 
and was taken to what was apparently the control room. And looking through a screen or window, she 
saw that they were hovering over New York City. Suddenly, without warning, in less than a second, 
the craft was now hovering over Los Angeles and then zoomed back over New York. This really 
impressed her. This was clearly a display for her benefit. And she asked them, "How do you do that?" 
So, the grays did it again. In the blink of an eye, they went to Los Angeles, hovered for a few 
seconds, and then snapped back to New York. And one of the grays asked her, "Do you understand?" 
and she told them, "Yeah." She started thinking of Star Trek and the transporter beam and told them, 
"You can disassemble all the elements and reassemble them." And one of the grays replied, 
"No, you don't have it right yet." And they continued to repeat the same cross-country 
maneuver for a third time, traveling between New York and Los Angeles. And then, as Pat says, 
then it put the answer in my head. And she told the ETSs, "I got it." And the answer amazed her. 
As Pat says, they expand and contract space is what it told me. They have the ability to 
expand and contract space. They don't have a propulsion system like you would think of it, 
an engine or a motor. It's not the object itself. It's the space around it that they move. So, that 
was one really interesting encounter for her where the ETSs explained a little bit how they maneuver 
their craft. She had another really amazing encounter, which she calls a trip to Egypt. 
This encounter was so bizarre and incredible that she honestly hesitated to reveal it. As Pat says, 
they took me underground somewhere where the pyramids are, Egypt. I was in this pyramid and 
I was waiting for someone. I'm down at the bottom of a ramp. And this woman shows me a being, one of 
the tall, skinny ones. Was tall and slender, big eyes, big head, long body. It walked down the ramp 
to where I was, and I thought how beautiful it was when it was walking down. It was an awesome, 
beautiful being. When it got down there, I looked into its eyes, and I had this horrible 
embarrassment. I couldn't tell what was me and what was it. It was like I couldn't separate 
what was me and what was this being. It was really confusing. I couldn't tell the difference between 
me and her. It was like we were the same person and I felt horribly embarrassed. So the beautiful 
tall gray proceeded to lead Pat down a corridor into this very large subterranean chamber. And as 
Pat says, it opened up into this big cavern like a big monstrous cave, almost an underground city. 
The floor was covered in these 6x6 foot beautiful burgundy tiles. There was an opening across that 
cage and you could look down on a city. The being led her across the tiled chamber to an opening and 
into this underground area. And as Pat says, there were lots of UFOs down there. There was other 
stuff there. And there was a huge column made out of crystal or glass. It had like cage lightning in 
it, like a power source. I got further down to the ground level. Now, as she's standing there 
next to this gray, suddenly one of the UFOs rose up, there was a loud bang as it dove directly into 
the rock wall. And Pat shouted out, alarmed, "It crashed." The being standing next to her told her, 
"What is an obstacle for you is not an obstacle for us." It was at this point that Pat realized 
that the craft had actually moved directly through the solid rock out of that secret chamber. And she 
doesn't remember anything else after this, but as she says, this was somewhere in the desert in 
Egypt. I know what that sounds like. So, she's had several of these onboard encounters. And finally, 
she had what she calls the last encounter. It was sometime in her mid50s. She had gone to bed one 
evening and as usual woke up on board a UFO. As Pat says, it was huge inside and along the wall it 
had these tables and seats and they said go sit. So that's what I did. I had to pee. I was thirsty 
but it said stay. So I was not moving. Suddenly three small what he perceived to be female grays 
entered the room. And as Pat says, these things were short. They looked almost like Mongaloid 
children. They were short, a light gray color, and sticky built. They didn't have any hair. Now, 
to Pat's displeasure, despite all the empty areas that they could have sat down at, they came over 
directly to her and sat down right next to her. And she turned to them and told them angrily, 
"Do you know how rude that is? This whole place is empty. Of all the places where you could sit, 
you had to sit here. I'm already scared of you people. There are other spots. This is my spot. 
These three little grays seemed to be amused by her reaction and told her, "But you're sitting 
in our spots." At this time each day, this is our spot. You are in our spot. We are not 
in yours. So Pat didn't continue to argue when the grays told her, "We have something to do." 
They proceeded to tell her that they were working on communications on the craft. They led her over 
to what Pat describes as quote a computer screen kind of thing. And the grays instructed her to 
quote look at it. So Pat looked at the screen and although the grays didn't speak, she somehow knew 
exactly what they were doing. As Pat says, I felt like they were recording everything that 
I had ever looked at, said, thought, or anything else that was in my brain. I felt like they took 
every thought, every experience, everything I have ever experienced on this planet out of my 
brain. It's like they made a carbon copy, a backup disc. I felt emptied. I'm sure they could spit out 
another me somewhere if they wanted to. They never explained anything. They're about taking care of 
business, whatever their business is. The entire experience, as far as Pat can remember, lasted 
only a few moments. And as she says, they stayed for a short time and then they left. She doesn't 
remember anything after that except waking up the next morning. And this was to be her last onboard 
encounter. She kind of jokes that since the ETSs now have a complete copy of all her memories, 
they no longer need the original. But this wasn't the end of her unusual experiences. She continued 
to have a lot of high stranges. These include, of course, many psychic experiences. For example, 
one night in 2009, she had a dream that she was talking with her childhood friend Mike. Only 
now he was all grown up. He was sitting along the edge of a spring and she saw that there 
was blood on his leg. And as Pat says, he told me that he had gotten married and had a baby, 
and he told me that he had drowned, and he wanted me to tell his wife that he was sorry to leave her 
by herself to raise the kid. So Pat was shocked by this dream. She knew there was something to 
it. So she called up her brother and asked about Mike and was he okay? And her brother said, "No, 
I was at Blue Springs with him yesterday and he drowned." So that is Pat Kate's experiences. 
Pat has now left this world for the great beyond. She died in 2017. She was 74 years old. Dealing 
with her encounters has had its challenges, but after it was over, she looked back on her 
experiences with restrained emotion. As she says, I make it like this is a little thing in my life, 
but it's not a little thing. It's just best to deal with it like it's a little thing. So, 
there you go. That's the story of Patricia Kate. I'm absolutely honored that she shared her story 
with me and frankly with all of you as well. It's such an important case. It really illustrates the 
pattern I see so often with many contactes. It starts out to be very frightening, confusing, and 
traumatic. But ultimately, there's a silver lining with a lot of these experiences. It woke Patricia 
up to a much wider universe. She also experienced this amazing psychic abilities and for her she was 
glad to have contact ultimately. Yes, it was a little bit of a burden and she explained that 
I think very clearly but I am absolutely amazed by her encounters and I think her encounters her case 
has so much to teach us. If you'd like to read more about Patricia Kate's experiences, her story 
is published in my book, Onboard UFO Encounters, which is available on Amazon. There are a lot of 
people who are having these kinds of events. Most don't talk about it, so I'm really amazed at her 
courage of coming forward. So, thank you once again for watching. I truly appreciate it. I 
hope you're doing well. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for 
the truth and most important of all, keep having fun and I will see you next week. Bye for now.
