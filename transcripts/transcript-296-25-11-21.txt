All UFO encounters are interesting, whether a sighting, a face-to-face encounter with humanoids or 
an onboard encounter. One category of cases that deserves more attention is known as a Close 
Encounter of the Second Kind. These are cases where UFOs affect the environment in some way. This 
video presents ten truly bizarre close encounters of the second kind, cases which boggle the mind 
and show that we still have much to learn about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.

IT WAS WATCHING US. On November 23, 1963, two students sat on the porch of their home in a 
construction town along the Mattagami River in Ontario, Canada. Without warning, a humungous 
metallic craft appeared about 200 feet away. It hung there silently, and the two boys had the 
feeling they were being watched. After a few moments, the craft moved off. Two days later, 
another group of witnesses in the area said the UFO swooped down above them and burned their skin.

VERY TERRIFYING. At 1am on July 30, 1968, a man from Claremont, New Hampshire observed a large 
glowing object fly at a very low altitude over his home. Two miles away and a half hour later, a 
family was woken up by apparently the same craft hovering in their backyard. The craft remained 
for two hours, scaring their dogs, and causing their children to start moaning in their sleep in 
a way they had never done before.

PULLED OVER BY A UFO. One night in January 1969, a young man was driving outside of Lake Wales, 
Florida when, through his rear-view mirror, he saw flashing blue lights behind his car. Thinking 
he was being pulled over by the police for speeding, he was shocked when the interior of his car 
lit up with blue light. As he parked, he saw that it wasn’t the police at all, it was a massive 
craft, which clearly wanted him to observe them.

IT WAS LOOKING FOR ME. On July 25, 1970, Etienne G. (age 16) was hiking in the countryside near his 
home in Les Bordes, France when he saw a shiny metallic object sitting on a hill among the ferns. 
He crept closer when suddenly it struck him with an orange beam of light, rendering him totally 
unable to move. He lost all track of time. An eerie silence reigned over the area. Some moments 
later, the craft took off.

WE WERE MISSING FOR A DAY. One afternoon in September 1973, two siblings stepped off the school 
bus near their home in Mansfield, Ohio. Looking up, they saw a gigantic, silver, cigar-shaped 
craft hovering silently overhead. The normally busy street was oddly devoid of traffic and people. 
The craft stayed for 15 minutes, then flew away. By the time they returned home, they had totally 
forgotten the sighting but found they were missing 24 hours of time.

SCARED STRAIGHT BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 22, 1974, Mrs. W. was parked along a remote 
country road south of Launceston, Tasmania when her radio acted up and her car filled with light. 
Looking up, she saw a craft approaching. The UFO moved right in front of her, no more than 5 feet 
above the road. Afterwards, she was so shaken up that she became ill. But even stranger were the 
effects on both her car and on part of her body.

WE WERE FROZEN IN TIME. One evening in June 1963, a mother and her two young children were 
talking a walk along a residential street in Phoenix, Arizona when, to their amazement, they 
came upon a UFO hovering right next to a person’s house. The normally busy street became 
utterly silent, and the woman felt immobilized and hypnotized. Managing to break her trance, 
she fled the area but found herself reacting emotionally in ways that surprised her.

A TIMELY UFO ENCOUNTER. On March 27, 1979, a man was driving along a beach front road towards Oak 
Bluffs, Massachusetts when he saw a green cylindrical craft coming out of the water. His radio 
acted strangely. He watched the craft move off into the distance. Rushing to the police, he was 
missing about 15 minutes time. But even stranger is how the encounter affected his watch.

COMPLETELY SPELLBOUND. On April 9, 1993, an elderly couple from Braunschweig Germany, was woken up 
by a UFO outside their window. They were unable to move as it hung there making a buzzing noise. 
Finally it moved off only to return shortly later. The event not only affected their animals, but 
he was physically affected, there was poltergeist-like activity in their home, and the Birch tree 
where the UFO hovered was badly burned.

MY BODY WAS NO LONGER MINE. On the morning of February 2, 2002, a young woman opened the kitchen 
blinds of her boyfriend’s home in Arlington, Washington when she was confronted by a blazing 
white light. To her shock it entered her body, nearly causing her to levitate off the floor, and 
then shot out of her body. Her boyfriend saw the whole thing happen. Afterwards, she began to 
display amazing psychic abilities.

Ten amazing cases, each showing us that UFOs can affect us and the environment in ways that we 
still don’t fully understand.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of 
UFOs and the Paranormal. Today I'm going to be talking about something a little bit different. 
I do love exploring humanoid cases. It's probably my favorite aspect of eupfology that and onboard 
UFO encounters. I have plenty of more cases of that kind to share with you. But today I'd like 
to talk about close encounters of the second kind. The title of today's episode is called We Were 
Frozen in Time. 10 truly bizarre Close Encounters of the Second Kind. I've got 10 cases from all 
over the world, including Canada, France, Germany, Tasmania, as well as six from the United States, 
including Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Washington. 
What's really interesting about UFO encounters is that the most common type of encounter is 
of course a close encounter of the first kind, a simple sighting, and there are literally millions 
of cases that have been documented coming from all over the world and really stretching back to 
prehistory. A close encounter of the second kind is an encounter in which the physical 
environment is affected in some way. These cases have a lot to teach us. There's still a lot of 
questions surrounding some of these encounters. So that's what I want to talk about today. Now, 
a close encounter of the third kind is of course involving humanoids. Close encounter of the fourth 
kind is being taken on board. And now we have a close encounters of the fifth kind, human 
initiated encounters. This was a classification system invented by J. Allen Highneck to really 
help us understand what's going on here. It can be a little confusing because let's face it, 
a close encounter of the fourth kind being taken on board really involves an encounter 
of the first, second, and third kind. And there are close encounters of the first kind involving 
telepathy. So where would you categorize that? It can be a little confusing. At any rate, 
close encounters of the second kind are a category that deserves a lot of attention because these 
cases have some really interesting aspects to them that again we still don't fully understand. 10 
cases I've got today reach from 1963 all the way to 2002. And I think you'll find them amazing, 
fascinating, and just as interesting actually as some of these humanoid encounters. So, let's 
just get started. And the first case I'd like to talk about today, I call it Was Watching Us. 
This occurred on November 23rd, 1963 in Madagami River. This is in Ontario, Canada. This is a very 
unusual encounter. What I like about this case is it involves two independent sets of witnesses. 
So, this is incredible confirmation and it's a very close encounter involving some quite unusual 
physiological effects. This case comes from prolific researcher Brian Vik. The primary witness 
is anonymous, so I'll call him Wade, but the case actually involves quite a few witnesses. began 
around 1000 a.m., a cold but bright sunny morning on November 23rd, 1963, as Wade and his friend 
Robert began their daily walk to school. Arriving at school, they were surprised to find that it was 
closed in honor of President Kennedy, who sadly had just been assassinated one day earlier. But 
now with the day off, the boys decided to go to Robert's house. At the time they were living 
in a temporary construction community located along the Madagami River in northern Ontario, 
Canada. This was about midway between James Bay and Capus Casing in Ontario. At the time, 
the boy's fathers were working on building three hydroelect electric dams, Little Long, 
Kipling, and Harmon, all located along the Madagami River. And once at Robert's house, 
they sat on his backstep practicing playing guitar. They were near the Smoky Falls Dam area 
just north of Little Long Dam, which overlooked a road known then as Smoky Falls Road. There was a 
grove of trees on the other side of the road about 200 f feet away. And I'll just let Wade describe 
what happened as he says in his own words, "As we sat there with Robert strumming away, 
I looked up and across the road. I never heard or noticed it arriving, but there it was just 
sitting there about 10 ft higher than the tallest tree in the first grove, which would put it about 
30 ft off the ground. I jabbed Robert with my elbow and pointed. We just sat there in silence 
watching it as it was watching us. It was huge. The diameter about 30 yards from top to bottom at 
the center. The dimension was at least and maybe greater than the height of the trees, six or seven 
yards in thickness. It appeared to be constructed of dull aluminum and was shaped like a saucer with 
the exception that the top and bottom halves did not join in a sharp edge. All the way around the 
center, it looked like dark windows 6 feet tall. As Robert and I watched, the craft tilted with 
the closest side to us down and the rear of the saucer up. It appeared that whoever was inside was 
trying to get a better look at us. It shifted back down to its original position and then 
drifted at low speed to the west and behind the trees. The total observation time was 1 minute, 
although it seemed longer at the time. This was no blinking flashing light in the corner of the sky. 
This was a saucer up close and personal. So Wade and Robert were amazed. And that was the 
last they saw of this saucer. But it was not the last time that they heard about it cuz after their 
encounter, this same craft apparently had more witnesses to visit. As Wade says, two or three 
nights after the encounter, my father received a phone call at home. I recall him being so angry 
as he grabbed the keys for the company truck and headed out. Construction workers need light 
to work by when the sun goes down. And dad had electricians running the diesel-powered lightning 
plants. Three electricians had just walked off the job and refused to return, claiming that they 
had come under attack by a low-flying saucer. One of the electricians claimed to have thrown 
a hammer at the saucer as it took a low pass at him and according to him, he hit it. Dad radioed 
for another crew to take over the position and was driving the electricians back to the construction 
camp, but had to stop often as one of the fellows was violently sick. The next morning, the sick 
fellow went to the clinic and the doctor and nurses applied cream and then bandaged him top to 
bottom to soothe and cover his burned, blistered skin. was the talk of the town for a while as 
folks puzzled over getting that bad of a sunburn while fully clothed working for the night shift. 
How interesting is that? I don't think anyone can truly understand what it's like to see a UFO until 
you actually have that experience. And skeptics can say anything they want, but once someone sees 
something like that that close up, they know they've moved from beyond belief or disbelief 
to actual firsthand experiential knowledge. And when someone reports being, you know, affected 
physiologically, like having a sunburn all over their body from a close approach of a UFO, well, 
there you go. That's absolute amazing evidence that is very hard to explain away. So now let's 
move to the next case. This one is absolutely bizarre. I call this one very terrifying. This 
one occurred on July 30th, 1968 in Claremont, New Hampshire. This is a multiple witness case 
and some of the effects, the secondary effects are really unusual. There's animal reactions, 
of course, but to me, it's what happened to this couple's children that really makes me wonder 
what's going on here. It's a crazy case. This case, or rather two clearly related cases, comes 
from KNCAP researcher Gordon Lore, and both were published in his book, Strange Effects from UFOs. 
It also appeared in the June July 1968 issue of the NIKAP publication UFO Investigator. It all 
began at 1:00 a.m. on July 30th, 1968 when a man employed at a manufacturing plant was carrying 
two buckets of water to his garden located outside his home in Claremont, New Hampshire. Looking up, 
he saw a quote bright round object float in a gentle arc low in the sky to the northeast. 
He said it was about the same size of a full moon, but clearly not the moon, and it was flying, 
he said, at an extremely low altitude. After it disappeared behind some trees, he rushed back into 
his apartment and noted the time as 12 a.m. Now, meanwhile, just two miles away, a married couple 
was in their new home in Claremont. The husband, I'll call him Cliff, was a land surveyor. His 
wife is also anonymous, so I'll call her Vera. They had just moved into their house and worked 
late at various tasks, including working in their rock garden. They were in their bedroom and still 
awake at around 1:30 or 2:00 a.m. along with their pet poodle. Their children were asleep in another 
bedroom, and their German Shepherd dog was in the garage. And this is when they noticed weird 
lights outside, which they first assumed were the northern lights. But going to the other window, 
they saw more lights, which they now thought might be people walking around with flashlights. 
But looking more closely, they realized it was something much stranger. A dome-shaped object 
about 20 ft wide hovering outside their home. They said it was only 10 ft above the ground and about 
230 ft away. They estimate was sending down a beam of light from the central under section of the 
craft. And in this beam of light, there was a sort of arm-like device reaching down to the ground 
or towards the ground. It was making a very loud buzzing noise. And no sooner did they notice this 
object when they also noticed strange reactions with both their dogs and their children. And 
although the children were still asleep, they were acting very strangely. As Vera, the mother says, 
"Our children were very restless. They were moaning as if something was hurting them. 
They were actually crying out in their sleep. The children are both quiet sleepers and once they are 
in bed, they do not wake up unless they are sick. So, it was clear that they were reacting somehow 
to the presence of this UFO. And so were the dogs. As Vera says, my poodle was most upset. He sleeps 
in our bedroom and he pawed the side of the bed until I put him in bed with us. He was actually 
shaking from being so upset. But my fear for the children was what upset me most. I kept saying 
to my husband, "What is going to happen to the poor children if someone should come into the 
house?" So after a few very long minutes, this object moved about 25 ft to the east. But then it 
remained there for the next 2 hours. Now, having just moved into this house, the couple had no 
telephone. They became increasingly frightened by this strange spectacle. both felt, as they said, 
quote, "isolated and terrified." The husband actually wanted to leave and drive for help, 
but his wife refused to let him leave. And during all this time, this object continued to make this 
high-pitched buzzing noise. Vera says, "During this time, I thought of all kinds of things. 
I kept hearing sounds throughout the house. Any other night, they wouldn't have meant a thing, but 
tonight they were most terrifying." Now, finally, at 4:30 a.m., the humming sound became louder. The 
light from the craft grew brighter, and the object finally moved off to the west, going 
over the treetops and disappearing off into the distance. It took them a few hours to calm down, 
at which point the husband drove to the Claremont Police Station and reported the incident to police 
captain Ernest M. FA, who reported this case to Nikap, which is how it became to be investigated. 
And as Vera says, "Our experience was very terrifying and I hope that it never happens 
again. However, if it should, I hope that my husband and I will be prepared by then to handle 
the matter in a better way." There you go. Another case with two sets of independent witnesses, 
the gentleman seeing the UFO just a few miles away before this couple did. But what's going 
on with their children? Makes me feel like there was perhaps some level of telepathic con contact 
there. Very hard to say. I'd love to talk to the children and see if they remember anything from 
that night. An hours long encounter too that I can see why the witnesses felt that this was very 
scary for them even though clearly they weren't harmed. But an absolute amazing case that not a 
lot of people know about. so many cases that are just being completely lost to posterity because 
the vast majority of people do not report them. Now, here's another case that I am quite sure you 
haven't heard about, but it's definitely worthy of being wellnown. I call this one pulled over by a 
UFO. This occurred in January of 1969, perhaps 1970. The witness isn't exactly certain about 
the date. This occurred in Lake Wales, Florida one evening. And this is a scene straight out of 
the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I'm not sure this would qualify as a Close Encounter 
of the Second Kind, but it's so interesting and unusual, I just had to include it. Given the main 
witness in this case, the pseudonym Brett, he is anonymous. And it was one evening in late January 
1969 or perhaps 1970 that Brett decided to drive to his father's house in Lake Wales, Florida. His 
father lived only 6 milesi away, so it wasn't a long drive and was one he had done many times. 
But on this occasion, something really remarkable happened. It was about 700 p.m. He had turned left 
on Highway 60 on a rural road. And as Brett says in his own words, "As I was about halfway there, 
I saw revolving blue lights in my rear view mirror. As I was in the city limits of town, 
I thought naturally that it was the local police pulling me over for a traffic violation. I thought 
perhaps I had been speeding or something. So I pulled over and stopped. At that moment, 
the interior of my pickup was flooded with light. I looked rearward and was shocked to find no one 
there. No police car, nothing. I then looked to my immediate right and I saw an immense object 
just sitting there over a citrus grove. The craft was exceedingly close, about 50 yards off to my 
right and about a telephone pole's height from the ground level. Was very luminous and quite large 
and was the typical saucer shape like two saucers put together. I had the distinct impression that 
it was observing me and I felt like they wanted me to see it. To say that I was apprehensive was 
a bit of an understatement. It was an absolutely beautiful craft. It was huge. I estimate about 50 
to 75 yards in diameter. It was well enveloped in light which didn't seem to radiate outward 
much if at all. It appeared to be made of a metal similar to aluminum, bright and shiny. There was 
absolutely no sound whatsoever. Brett had always been interested in UFOs and he had read several 
accounts of so-called abductions. So, he was understandably nervous about this close presence 
of the UFO. As he says, I was scared stiff. I felt that my best recourse would be to leave. 
After I left, I looked back and it was gone. I don't know, but for a long time after that, 
I couldn't seem to tell anyone about it, like it wasn't important or something. I didn't have any 
missing time, so I'm quite sure I wasn't abducted. But another strange thing about this is that the 
UFO or whatever it was didn't arrive and leave in the conventional matter. It just appeared and then 
disappeared. Poof, gone. It was the most vivid thing I've ever seen. There were several things 
about this sighting that to me were peculiar. The first was the use of police lights. The UFO used 
simulated police lights to pull me over and then apparently sat there observing me. The second was 
the fact that this happened in a well populated area. A church and a hospital were nearby as well 
as in a residential area. I shall never forget it. I think my sighting is very unique and that 
I was pulled over by a UFO was almost on top of my truck. They were observing me and had forced 
me to pull over. Sometimes I wish I could see it again. So yeah, I'm not sure that would qualify 
as a close encounter of the second kind, but let's face it, it did affect the environment 
in terms of the witness himself. And that has to be intentional. I mean, gosh, this UFO coming down 
right behind somebody and mimicking police lights, it's very much like what happened to Richard Rifus 
in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And I do know of other cases like that. It's kind of 
an amusing case, but I'm sure for the witness at the time, he was not laughing. Maybe now he is, 
but so unusual. Now, let's move to the next case, which I call it Was looking for me. This one does 
qualify as a close encounter of the second kind because the witness was struck by a beam of light, 
which rendered him unable to move. This absolutely affected him physiologically. 
It's a good example of the so-called Oz effect as well. This one occurred on July 25, 1970 in Jabre 
Leort in France. And this one is interesting to me because this gentleman stumbles upon a UFO in 
a pretty isolated area. And again, as the title suggests, he feels that it was looking for him. 
This case first appeared in the August 1971 issue of the French UFO magazine Lumiere Dolanui or 
Lights in the Night. And in fact, it was the cover story. The witness is known only as ATN Xi. He was 
16 years old at the time of his encounter working as a baker's apprentice in the commune of Jabra 
Leard in Otvien, France. was on the afternoon of July 25, 1970 that he decided to go hiking to 
collect some edible mushrooms in the countryside near his home in the village of Leorg. Having 
grown up there, he was very familiar with the terrain and the woods. He reached an area about 
700 m from his home, less than a half mile, known as Pu Forno, Little Furnace. You can see it here. 
It's a small hill about 480 m high, 1500 ft. It's a very lush, verdant area, thick with trees and 
ferns. And in fact, the ferns were almost as tall as ATN himself. He measured 5 1/2 ft tall. 
It was around 5:30 p.m. and the sun was growing low on the horizon as ATN was climbing down the 
western slope of this small hill when he noticed a metallic looking dome right in front of him. 
no more than 15 meters away, less than 50 feet, was sitting among the ferns, right in front of a 
grove of fur trees. Now, at knew that there were no structures there, so he stopped in shock, but 
he was also intrigued and curious, so he took a few more steps forward and used his walking stick 
to pull the ferns apart so he could get a better view. And the moment he did this, he was instantly 
dazzled by a very bright yellow orange light emanating from the object, or rather from three 
rectangular squares located immediately below the top dome. Now, the light was so bright it 
was difficult for him to see the object clearly, but he could just discern that there appeared to 
be a wider lower saucer-shaped section below the lights. Now, he compared the texture or the color 
of this object to a wrapper of a chocolate bar, in other words, silver. So, ATN's initial curiosity 
now turned to fear as he found himself utterly immobilized by the light. Although he wanted to 
flee, he was unable to move forward or backwards. He just stood there with his right foot placed 
forward, exactly where it was when he parted the ferns. He was still able to move his eyes and 
the glare from the light was almost blinding as he says as if it were coming from a lighthouse and he 
had the distinct impression that as he says it was looking for me. Now he's not sure how long this 
part of his experience lasted because he said he seemed to have lost all sense of time. He didn't 
notice that the orange yellow beams of light had a very thin green beam in the center. He also 
noticed that everything seemed to be unusually quiet and still. Then after an undetermined period 
of time, the craft began to rise upwards. The beam left his body and he could now get a clear view 
of the craft and could also move. He could now clearly see the narrow dome on top of the craft. 
Below that, a row of three or four squareish windows. and below that a wider saucer shape 
with what looked like three or four circular port holes around the circumference. He estimates it 
was about five to six meters or 15 to 20 ft wide and about 2.5 to 3 m high, 7 to 9 ft, really about 
the size of a van. He did also notice three short antenna on top and very quickly this craft moved 
off into the distance and disappeared. That's the kind of case that raises a lot of questions for 
me. What was that UFO doing there? Was it waiting for this gentleman? Was this a random encounter? 
Why did it strike him with this beam of light? Was he truly paralyzed by the beam of light or was 
this more of a sort of frozen in fear response? Because I think that does take place in a lot 
of these cases. People assume they're immobilized but at some point break free. they absolutely kind 
of overcome the fear perhaps and are able to run away. I don't know. Very hard to say, but I think 
that these are the kinds of cases we need to take a closer look at because these kinds of questions 
need to be answered. We don't know the answer to a lot of these weird effects that people are having 
with close encounters. Now, let's move to this next case. This one is absolutely bizarre and 
incredible. I call this one We Were Missing for a Day. This occurred in September 1973 in Mansfield, 
Ohio. 1973 has been called the year of the humanoids. And towards the end of the year, 
se September and October, the number of cases in this area was off the charts. This case doesn't 
involve humanoids, but it's very close to the very famous Captain Coin incident. 
with a helicopter which was apparently lifted by a UFO levitated to some degree. A lot of cases in 
this area at that time and this one is so unusual for a number of reasons. This case which involves 
two teenage witnesses has not been formally investigated. But one of the witnesses is now a 
police captain and he has provided his firstirhand eyewitness testimony of a really remarkable UFO 
encounter which involves what appears to be 24 hours of missing time. As he is anonymous, 
I'll use the pseudonym Elliot. It was one afternoon in September or October of 1973. Elliot, 
then aged 16, and his 13-year-old younger sister, had just been dropped off the school bus in front 
of their home on Cook Road. This is in suburban Mansfield, Ohio. You can see it here. This area 
was a busy two-lane road with homes on either side of the road, about a half block from a school and 
a convenience store. So, a pretty populated area. And I'll just let Elliot describe what he saw. As 
Elliot says, I had exited the bus before my sister and stood waiting for her on the sidewalk. As she 
stepped from the bus and it pulled away, I was startled to see a large object hovering over the 
street where the school bus had been. I pointed it out to my sister and we both stood, captivated 
by its appearance and proximity. The craft was approximately 40t long and 15 or 20 feet tall. 
It hovered silently 35 or 40 ft overhead and had lights encircling its cigar- shaped structure. I 
believe there was a larger red light on one end and a green light on the other, but the rest of 
the smaller lights were multicolored. It was of a metal which looked like brushed aluminum and 
had no visible means of levitation or propulsion. No wings, no propellers. I walked into the street 
underneath the craft and across the street to see it from the other side. There were no numbers or 
letters of any kind displayed, and I could not see any seams for the release of landing apparatus. At 
one point, I picked up a rock to hear what it would sound like bounced against the exterior, 
but my sister dissuaded me from throwing it. We became increasingly distressed as I was not able 
to identify this object, and by the fact that we were alone. So Elliot and his 13-year-old sister 
just stood there and stared at this craft in astonishment, confusion, and some disbelief 
for the next 15 minutes. And they did notice a few very odd details. As Elliot says, it had been at 
least 15 minutes since we first saw the craft. And during this time, remarkably, no one had passed 
by. No one came out onto their front porch. No other kids walked the sidewalks and no cars drove 
by. In retrospect, this seems absurd given the time of day and the usual traffic on Cook Road. 
We walked around and underneath the craft for 15 or 20 minutes, while it remained motionless 
and soundless above what should have been a busy suburban street. When I returned to the side of 
the street on which my sister stood, I now saw a small black oval slightly above the row of lights. 
We thought it might be a window and waved, but there was no response. Several minutes later, 
the craft silently shot up and into a small cumulus cloud which drifted away. So, 
at this point, Elliot's sister turned to him and asked, "What was it?" And Elliot replied, 
"I don't know. Do you think it could be one of those UFOs the papers been writing about?" So, 
neither of them knew what it was, but the biggest shock was yet to come. As Elliot says, 
we were both excited and scared as we walked into our house, whereupon we both completely forgot 
about it. Although we had no apparent memory of the event, I recall that we were both very upset 
with our mother, whom we accused of leaving us for a 24-hour period. Mom insisted she had 
never done such a thing, but we were convinced we had experienced a full 24 hours without her. Now, 
for a few years, the entire encounter was shrouded in complete amnesia. But one day, 
by sheer synchronicity, Elliot spontaneously recalled the encounter. As he says, "We both 
completely forgot this incident for 3 years. 3 years after our encounter, I had a sudden recall 
of the events described above while talking about the cosmos with some college friends. 
I called my sister and asked her if she had ever seen a flying saucer. And at first, she said no. 
But when I mentioned the school bus in Ohio, she also had a sudden realization and literally gasped 
on the phone. Her memory of the event is almost exactly like my own, including the little window 
and the strange missing time. The missing time was particularly perplexing to both of us and to 
this day remains a disturbing reality. I know I am missing a day, but I cannot explain it. 
Both of us felt then and now that we are missing a 24-hour period of our lives. I'm still fearful of 
what I saw, but I am more afraid of what I cannot remember. I suppose I'm just pretty damned average 
in every way except for this nagging experience which continues to haunt me. Now Elliott does 
admit that there are a few other very unusual events in his life which are certainly related. He 
recalls that he used to tell quote strange stories of little men when I was very young but as he says 
life goes on but I sure wish I could understand the what's and wise of this event. As we know, 
missing time as the result of a UFO encounter is not unusual, but generally speaking, it's anywhere 
from 20 minutes to an hour or two and perhaps longer, but 24 hours. That's crazy. I really 
wonder about this case because this UFO appeared exactly as these children were coming off the bus, 
as if it was waiting for them. It hung there for a long time. Where was all the traffic? This is 
a really good example of the strange Oz effect. There should be traffic and people going up and 
down this pretty busy street. Where were they? I suspect that they were pulled perhaps into the 
fourth dimension. I don't know. I'm speculating here, but we have to account for these weird 
effects and they're still not fully understood. It's also interesting that not only were they 
missing 24 hours, they completely forgot about the UFO encounter for a couple of years until just by 
chance they the the brother spontaneously recalled this. So that makes me wonder how many people have 
had an encounter like this and don't really remember it at all because it's just buried in 
amnesia. An amazing case which raises all kinds of questions. Now, let's move to the next case. This 
one is so unusual. I have never heard anything like this in terms of effects on a witness. I call 
this one scared straight by a UFO. It's not what you're thinking. I'm guessing I'd be surprised if 
you've heard of this case. The physical effects on the witness are again so bizarre. This one 
occurred on September 22nd, 1974 in Lanson. This is in Tasmania, Australia. This is a very close 
encounter, and I think you'll find this incredibly fascinating because of what happened to this 
witness. This case comes from Paul B. Jackson, MUN research associate for Tasmania and the co-founder 
of the Tasmanian UFO Investigation Center. It appeared in the January 1975 issue of Mufon's 
Skylook Journal. The witness is known only as Mrs. W. Late on the afternoon of September 22nd, 
1974, she was on Ditiliam Road in the Tayen area about 30 mi northeast of Lonsistan, Tasmania, 
Australia. She was in her car and had pulled off the narrow road to wait for a relative to 
arrive. She was listening to her radio, which just announced that the time was 5:20 p.m., so she knew 
the exact time. when suddenly a brilliant bright light coming from outside the car illuminated 
the interior. At that same moment the radio began to emit a high-pitched whistle. So Mrs. 
W leaned forward with the intention of turning off the radio and looking up through the windshield. 
She now saw the source of the illumination because up above the hill on the left side of the road, 
there was a glowing orange and silver object maneuvering between two trees and coming down 
the hill towards her and the road. Now seeing that this object was heading straight for her, MissW 
panicked and leaving the radio on in her haste, she started up the car and started backing up the 
road. This object approached slowly. She can now see that it was about the size of a large car, was 
about 50 to 60 ft above the ground and descending as it came down towards the road. By the time it 
came over the road, it was only 5 ft above the road and about 60, maybe 90 ft away. The car radio 
was still making the same whining noise. Mrs. W had backed up her car about 300 ft, at which point 
it became stuck on the edge of the road. The UFO now hovered stationary above the road ahead of her 
for about 60 seconds. She could see it perfectly except that the glare from the upper dome of the 
craft was so bright it made it difficult to look at. She could see it had a dome on top, but the 
orange yellow light coming from it was really bright that she had trouble estimating its size. 
Beneath the dome, she could see that the craft was metallic silver gray. It had a wide brim with what 
looked like port holes. And below this, there were a half a dozen bands encircling the object. This 
section was about 12 ft wide she estimates and at the base in the center was a small revolving disc 
and below this she could see a box or a tube of some kind protruding from the bottom of the craft. 
So after hovering the craft then dipped over to the right and moved away from the road over 
a valley to the southwest. Then it suddenly went straight up very quickly and disappeared into the 
distance. As it moved off, it looked like the tube object on the bottom split into four sections. And 
Miss W estimates that the entire encounter lasted about four minutes. A pretty interesting sighting. 
But there were some very interesting and truly bizarre after effects. One was that the radio, 
which had worked perfectly prior to the encounter, no longer worked properly, and the sound that came 
out of it was permanently distorted. Prior to the encounter, the car was very dirty. In fact, 
there were cat footprints all over the front hood. But following the encounter, the front half of the 
car looked as though it had been professionally polished clean, while the back half remained 
as dirty as before. But the third and most bizarre effect Miss W noticed immediately. 
She had just had her hair freshly permed into curls, but following the encounter, her permed 
hair turned immediately straight. The only other effects was that Mrs. W was so emotionally shaken 
by the encounter that she was sick for a number of days afterwards. Prior to this sighting, 
she had never believed in UFOs. But following the encounter, of course, she changed her mind and 
became a believer. Investigators did check the area for any marks or magnetic variations, but 
nothing was found. Interestingly, the RAAF also showed interest in the encounter and interviewed 
the witness personally. Ultimately, investigators concluded that Mrs. W had seen something truly 
unconventional, that she had a quote low-level daylight sighting of an unexplained aerial object. 
That absolutely qualifies as a close encounter of the second kind. There must be some energy field 
surrounding these craft that allowed this woman to uh have her hair straightened. How weird is that? 
Uh, also it cleaned her car. So, I don't know. Very odd. I've never heard anything quite like it. 
I've heard of areas being swept clean of dust and things like this and strange effects on cars 
as well, but I've never heard of anyone's hair being straightened, lifted up perhaps in a static 
electric charge. So perhaps it's related to that, but how bizarre is that? That definitely qualifies 
as a truly bizarre encounter and a close encounter of the second kind. And now let's move to the next 
one. This one is again a really good example of this weird Oz effect, this eerie silence, 
the lack of traffic and other witnesses, though this one does involve another witness and it's 
very strange. I call this one We were frozen in time. This occurred one evening in June of 
1978 in Phoenix, Arizona in a very crowded residential suburb. And I wanted to include 
this case because the witness is so lucid. She describes this in such incredible detail. She's 
very obviously sincere and intelligent. And it's a very interesting encounter which apparently does 
involve missing time as well. This case comes from APRO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, 
and was published in the April 1978 issue of the APRO bulletin. It was around 9:00 p.m. one 
evening in May or June of 1963, not se 1978, 1963, as a mother and her two children had 
taken a walk and were returning to their home in residential Phoenix, Arizona. And as they reached 
the 1100 block of East Portland Street near the intersection of 12th Street, not far from their 
home, you can see it here. This is when they saw a strange craft which was hovering right next to 
someone's home. And I'll just quote the witness directly as she says, "I found it difficult to 
believe that anything that size and shape could maneuver itself into a position so close to the 
house. Was absolutely silent. My chief concern was for the children that they not be frightened, but 
I myself was severely shaken. In fact, terrified. I'm sure this was because whatever it was was so 
close, not more than 18 to 20 feet from me and roughly 15 to 18 ft from the ground. The object 
itself was round with three concentric circular rings lessening in size from the outer edge to 
the center. It was exceptionally beautiful and about the size of a compact car, perhaps slightly 
larger. I can't adequately describe the whiteness and the brilliance. There aren't any words for it. 
The lines of the craft were clearly drawn except for one specific area here. The intense glow and 
luminescence made it impossible to describe anything. Was kind of a rim-like halo, and 
the glow seemed to radiate within. The top of the craft was completely white and smooth and appeared 
flat. Though it was very bright white, the bottom was dark and appeared even flatter. The bottom 
appeared to be dull metal, medium to dark gray in color with some kind of tube-like protrusion 
visible at an angle to the left side. So according to the witness, this craft had no windows, 
but there was no doubt in her mind that this was clearly a craft of some kind and as she said, 
an unidentified aerial object. She felt rooted to the spot and just stared at it in absolute 
astonishment and some fear. And as strange as its appearance was, the weirdness had only just 
begun because it was around this time she noticed what researchers have come to term the Oz effect. 
As the witness says, the eerie aspect was the absolute silence as the thing just hung there in 
space, stationary for a few moments, after which it began to waver slightly, or quiver would be a 
better word. The wavering motion made me fearful of a possible hypnotic influence. Not far from the 
craft, on the left side of the front lawn, stood a middle-aged man holding a hose. He was in shadow, 
dressed in workclo, and looked fairly ordinary. The area was quite dark. The only light was from 
the object reflecting upwards and a nearby street light. I was on the verge of saying, "Sir, do you 
see what I see?" But I could not speak. He paid no attention to the craft, nor to me. All of this 
occurred in less than one minute, or so it seemed. I lost all track of time. It seemed as if all life 
had stopped, except for the three of us, as if we were somehow frozen in time. Even the sound of 
insects could no longer be heard. Though normally the neighborhood was overrun with dogs and cats, 
there were none at the time of the sighting. It was as if everything had suddenly stopped 
or been suspended in time. I saw no autos in motion. I knew I had to get away quickly as I 
had the distinct feeling something might happen to us. I was more than a little agitated and 
mainly concerned for the safety of my children because I felt we were somehow being observed. 
Now, it was at this point that the witness was so overwhelmed with the strangeness of the situation 
that she managed to break free of her trance and get away from this object. But she then found that 
the encounter was affecting her emotionally in ways she did not expect. As the witness says, 
"When I first cited the object, I only thought, my god, what is that? I wanted to run but could 
not. I was able to walk away and my feeling of fear gave way to a kind of euphoria. I was 
suddenly happy and I can't explain why. I was very much afraid during the encounter. Upon leaving 
the scene, I felt a sense of euphoria and finally sadness. When I reached home, it seemed very late, 
later than it should have been, and I sent the children to bed. I pushed open the screen door 
because I wanted to go back, but still I was somehow afraid. I knew the UFO would be gone and 
I had this feeling of sadness and depression. Just amazing the way this witness describes 
this UFO being so close to it. The missing time aspect, this other gentleman watering his plants, 
not even paying any attention to the UFO makes me wonder about that. I mean, I have no answers 
to why he wouldn't be more excited to see this UFO, unless maybe he didn't even see it. I don't 
know. The emotional reaction to this witness is also interesting being so fearful and yet 
at the end of this encounter feeling this wave of sadness and depression very unusual. I think it 
does point towards the very strong possibility of an onboard encounter or more than she fully 
remembers because again she did say when she got home she was surprised to see that it was so late. 
Missing time can often be seamless. people just don't know. So, I've come to realize that whenever 
anyone has a very close encounter within a couple of hundred feet, the chances of this 
being a much much more extensive encounter go way, way up. Now, let's move to the next case. Again, 
a really unusual case with some aspects to it that are very difficult to explain. This is another one 
you probably haven't heard before. I call this one a timely UFO encounter. This occurred on March 27, 
1979. This is in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This is on the island of Martha's Vineyard. 
Pretty heavily populated. This one is a bizarre one for sure. This case comes from Mufon field 
investigator Joseph Nyimman, who was referred the case by Raymond Fowler. It came to his attention 
when the local police at Martha's Vineyard called him. The witness is Ed Brown. That's a pseudonym. 
He was 19 years old at the time of his encounter. Was 10 p.m. on March 27, 1979. As he drove north 
along the Edgartown Oak Bluffs Road, right along the eastern shoreline of Martha's Vineyard. You 
can see it here. And as he drove, he noticed an odd green glow behind the sand dunes on his right, 
and thought to himself that it must be people on the beach using glow sticks. But as he drove, 
this glow became brighter, and then his radio started to emit a quote low frequency hum. So he 
reached a point in the road where his view was no longer obstructed by the sand dunes and then was 
amazed to see a luminous green cylindrical-shaped object with rounded ends floating on the water 
about 200 f feet away. He immediately stopped the car and watched from the driver's seat as 
this object rose up out of the water. And as it got so high that his car roof blocked his view, 
he exited the car so he could keep viewing it. He said that the object was so bright that it 
was illuminating both the water and the beach below it. And then this object began to move, 
increasing in speed. Ed recalled that he had a 12vt flashlight in his car. So he started to reach 
into the car, but to his surprise, he was suddenly paralyzed, unable to move any part of his body 
except his head. So he just watched this object as it continued to rise upwards and out of sight. 
Now, Ed estimated that the entire encounter lasted about 6 minutes. Though, when he later reenacted 
it in the presence of researcher Joseph Nyman, they lowered the estimate down to about 2 minutes. 
Though to Ed, he said it seemed much longer. Now, impressed by this event, Ed immediately 
drove to the Oakluffs Police Station, you can see it here, and reported the sighting. Joseph 
Nyman spoke with the officer who took the report and he saw that this was logged in at 10:30 p.m. 
which verifies the time. And the officer said that Ed was unusually excited and somewhat frightened 
which surprised him because he knew Ed. Ed himself was in fact an auxiliary police officer. Now, 
there's a slight discrepancy of time here because Ed knew that the sighting occurred at 10 p.m. as 
he was listening to the radio at the time. The drive to the station takes only 10 minutes and 
this sighting was no longer than 6 minutes. So there is about a 15 to possibly 25 minutes of 
time that is unaccounted for. There was one final mystery. At the time of the encounter, 
Ed was wearing a calendar watch that was malfunctioning. It was reading 3 days ahead 
of normal time and was running consistently too fast. But following the encounter, this watch, 
which was a manual Timex watch, was now not only reading the correct date, it stopped 
running fast. So it looked as if the encounter had somehow not only corrected the date on the watch, 
but fixed the watch itself. They did test the watch with a compass to see if it was magnetized, 
and it showed that no, it had not been magnetized. But as Joseph Nyman, the researcher, writes, "The 
most puzzling aspect of this case then and still now is the watch correction issue." A lot of these 
UFO cases display weird time effects. Whether it's missing time, I've talked to people who had 
essentially added time, got to their location far earlier than they should have, or people who have 
an onboard encounter that lasts for hours, and yet they were returned minutes after the encounter. 
So, there's all kinds of things going on here that we don't fully understand. That's why I wanted to 
include this encounter because the whole time aspect of UFO encounters is very puzzling. So 
many questions still to be answered about what's going on here. Now, let's move to the next case, 
which I call completely spellbound. This occurred on April 9, 1993 in Brownwag, Germany. This is a 
multiple witness case. This one you may have heard of, I don't know, but it did receive considerable 
publicity, but I wanted to include it because this witness is very credible being a military officer 
and there were multiple witnesses as well and very very close up sighting with some incredible 
physiological effects. I mean really the entire range from animal reactions to electromagnetic 
disturbances to physiological effects to landing traces. So it's the kind of case that is truly 
undeniable. This case comes from German researcher Dr. Peter Hatwig, the founder of Dufo. This is the 
German UFO Investigation Group and it originally appeared in the Dugaf forum journal number 11, 
but also appeared in the winter 1996 issue of the Flying Saucer Review and 
in several other publications. It's become quite wellknown. Regarding the witness in this case, 
researcher Peter Hatwig says, "What he had to tell me was more astounding than science fiction. This 
case involves two primary witnesses, Irwin Lur and his wife. Irwin was 72 years old at the time 
of his encounter and was living with his family in Brown. This is a heavily populated city in central 
Germany. Now, he's a former fighter pilot and an accomplished artist. Was shortly after midnight 
on April 9, 1993 that Irwin woke up to an unusual stabbing pain at the base of his spine. He didn't 
think much of it. Just took a painkiller and went back to bed. But before he could fall back asleep, 
something very strange happened that not only shocked him, but woke up his wife. As he says, 
"Suddenly, we heard a clear humming sound coming from the sky. After 3 or 4 seconds, 
this noise, which seemed metallic, as though produced by a centrifugal force, 
grew louder. And then through the bedroom window, we saw a bright round shining object stationary 
at a height of some 10 m or so above the birch trees to the east. Our bedroom in the terrace 
outside was lit by a bluish white color like neon lighting. Being a former fighter pilot, I wanted, 
of course, to see what was going on. But when I tried to stand up, I found that I couldn't move. 
And with my wife, it was just the same. We were both totally paralyzed. Also, our two kittens, 
which sleep on the foot of the bed, were both sitting there bolt upright and looking as though 
turned to stone. Meanwhile, our bedroom window was being bathed on and off in a bright yellow 
beam of light, apparently coming down from above. Now, Irwin was more annoyed at not being able to 
move than he was afraid, though his wife reports that she herself was terrified. Irwin had the 
impression that the occupants of the craft were seeking him personally as he said, "Absolutely, 
for it was hovering right there beside my bedroom window, as though they knew exactly 
where I was. It shimmerred with all the colors of the rainbow, white, green, red, yellow. The 
Koopa was a bright shining silver. The underside had three colored apertures and a central light. 
The eerie apparition lasted altogether about 40 seconds or so. Then the vivid light ended 
abruptly. Then some 30 or 40 seconds later, we saw the UFO fly over our bedroom window in 
a westerly direction and vanish. Simultaneously, the paralysis ended for both of us. My wife was 
too upset to sleep anymore, and so was I. Now Irwin's wife had, as Irwin says, 
a thorough fit of the shakes. And while it seemed as though the encounter was over, in truth, many 
more high strangers events were about to occur. Because, as Irwin says, about a half hour later, 
we heard the same sound again coming from the other direction. Our bedroom has windows on two 
sides. So, we got a full view of the UFO for the first time. From a distance of about 300 meters, 
we watched it flying straight towards us. We heard the same sounds as before, and for about 
six seconds, we could see its shape clearly. Then, just as about the disc, which I estimate was about 
10 m wide, was nearly right over us. Something quite unbelievable happened. It simply dissolved 
into thin air. Between 1/10enth of a second and another, it was gone without any transition. 
Now, being an artist, Irwin immediately produced a few sketches of the craft. But still, even more 
strange events were soon to happen because it was the next day at 400 p.m. that their TV set 
started acting very strangely. It emitted a bright flash of light and made this very loud crackling 
sound. And 1 hour later, their two other TV sets that were downstairs emitted what he called quote 
phenomenal discharges. Their computer also shut down by itself. And then at 1000 p.m., 
something even more bizarre happened. As Irwin says, a tremendous banging started up inside our 
wardrobe, as though someone was shut in there. But despite all our efforts and our searching, 
we could find absolutely no reason for the noise. And every time we opened the wardrobe, 
the den stopped. On and off, the eerie happenings went on for a further 8 weeks and disturbed us. 
badly. Now, another apparently related effect was that Irwin continued to experience a strange pain 
in his lower spine. And after a week of dealing with it, he finally used a mirror to examine the 
area of the pain. And this is when he discovered two red marks at the very base of his spine. He 
went to the doctor who said that he saw what looked like two black spots below the skin 
where the marks were. The doctor applied some ointment and referred Irwin to have a cat scan. 
And as Irwin says, "But before I was able to go there, two little black lensshaped things came out 
of my back. I put them away carefully to show them to the doctor, but by the second day following, 
they had simply disappeared." Now, Irwin had no idea how to explain these objects or 
where they went. And when researcher Peter Hatwig mentioned the possibility of an onboard encounter, 
Irwin was absolutely shocked. He had never heard of such a thing. But he later researched 
it and considered trying hypnosis, but so far has not done so. And there were a few final 
things that happened. After being interviewed by reporters and sharing his encounter publicly, 
it was published in the local newspaper, and Irwin was then contacted by about 25 different people, 
including an entire bowling team, all of whom told him that they had also witnessed what was 
apparently the same object on that night. All of them refused to go public as eyewitnesses 
out of fear of ridicule. And finally, there was one bit of evidence. In addition to 
the weird electromagnetic disturbances, the animal reactions, the physiological effects, 
there were apparent ground traces caused by the close proximity of the craft. As Dr. Peter Hatwig 
says the birch tree below the UFO had been burnt in the episode and indeed has not fully recovered 
today as its leaves are turning curly and falling already although it is still summer. Edwin Lore 
showed me the spot. Now this was 2 years after the encounter. There you go. Another case that 
raises I think more questions than it answers. My main question is what the heck is this UFO doing? 
hovering right outside of this guy's house in a downtown city location. It's crazy. I do think 
that there's probably deeper levels of contact here given that he was apparently implanted and 
all the weird kind of poltergeist like effects going on. It's crazy. These kinds of cases, 
I think, comprise a good portion of UFO encounters and don't receive the attention they deserve. It's 
amazing to me that we have congressional hearings and they're still talking pretty much primarily 
about sightings. Yes, to some extent crash retrievals, but there are so so many cases 
where people are having very close contact and they're not talking about that which is puzzling 
to me because I think this is where we can get a lot of the answers. This is where the data is. We 
can learn so much from these kinds of cases and for that reason alone, I think we need to take 
them seriously. And again, that's the kind of case that you just can't deny with all this evidence. 
So, now let's move to the last and final case in this compilation. This one to me is probably 
the most profound and unusual. I'm not sure it would even qualify as a UFO encounter, though it 
was reported as such. So, I am including it here because it definitely could be a UFO encounter, 
but it might have another explanation. I call this one My Body Was No Longer Mine. This occurred on 
February 2nd, 2002 in Arlington, Washington. And thank God, this witness had another witness with 
her. So, it's a multiple witness encounter because if this had happened to her alone, 
I think it probably would have caused her to question her sanity. That's how unusual this case 
is. As we'll see, this very unusual encounter, yes, is very difficult to categorize, but it is 
certainly unexplained. The witness is anonymous, so I'll call her Tina. And again, thankfully, Tina 
did have another witness, her former boyfriend. It was around 700 a.m. on the morning of February 
2nd, 2002, as Tina drove to his one-bedroom apartment located in Arlington, Washington. 
They were planning to go out for breakfast, but instead found themselves in his kitchen having a 
deep philosophical conversation about the subject of religion and how it's helped or hindered them. 
The kitchen was kind of shadowed and dark. So Tina asked if she could open the window and her 
boyfriend said, "Go ahead." It was at that moment that Tina's life changed forever. As Tina says, 
I pulled the blinds away and was instantly blinded by this very white bright light. Yet, it didn't 
make me squint to look at it. As I turned back to face him 2 and 1/2 to 3 ft away, I suddenly felt 
this sensation of being suspended in animation. I quit feeling the floor under my feet, and 
everything was white and hazy. But I could still see my boyfriend standing in front of me. My body 
was no longer mine and I somehow leaned really far forward as I was close to his face. Then I slanted 
back again at the same angle, but I hadn't moved my feet or legs as I would have done naturally 
to catch myself from falling, but I didn't. Right after that, I saw a portal. It was about 7 ft tall 
and 5 ft wide. It was liquid looking like water. I don't know if it came over me or I into it, 
but there was a sound when I went through that I'll never forget. The white light was brighter, 
and I still felt suspended in animation. Suddenly, there was this white ball of light coming around 
me. It was the size of a basketball, very white and very bright. It came to my torso and began to 
push itself into my body. I could feel it push and then popped through into me all the way. 
It bounced around inside of me a few times, and then I began to feel it trying to exit on my left 
side. It popped out completely, rolled around me a few times, then took off fast. Before it left, 
though, it put me back down on my feet, but it was at such a backward angle that I had to put my 
foot back so I didn't fall down, and I could. As the orb of light exited Tina's body and took off, 
it then emitted a shower of golden light all over her. Tina was so stunned and dumbfounded that 
all she could do was stand there. And finally, she turned to her boyfriend. And as Tina says, 
now that I was back in my senses and my body, so to speak, I just asked myself, 
"WTF just happened." I looked up at my boyfriend and his usual brown skin was white in his face. 
His jaw was open and he looked as astonished as I did. And I asked him, "WTF just happened?" 
I don't know, he told her. And as Tina says, so we sat down and tried to relax, but we were both 
so shaken up that we began to go into shock. I had to know what he saw. So I asked him, and he said, 
"As I drew up the kitchen blinds, this golden white orb came from behind me and lit up my red 
hair golden." He said it was beautiful, like I was an angel. He saw it enter my right torso. 
He also saw it while it was within me too and saw it come out. Now in our talking, we're 
really starting to shake uncontrollably in shock. It was just so hard to even attempt to understand 
this. So the encounter left both of them with more questions than answers. As Tina says, 
was this spiritual or was it an ET encounter? She doesn't know, but the effect of the encounter on 
her has been longlasting and ongoing. As she says, I feel like I've had information downloaded into 
me. I got a message, too, that quote, "We humans often cannot tell the difference between angels 
and aliens." She says, "I've had many knowings where I just know stuff that I haven't studied. 
I became in tune with spirit and have acted as a medium for many friends. But now that seems gone." 
The experience did not scare me. It gave me hope and I feel that I've got family elsewhere. The 
entity that came to me was a benefit to my life. Was so white and bright. It was just pure energy. 
They don't need a body, just light. It showed me what my mission was. Visions and dreams, etc. I'm 
a very lucid dreamer. Fun, but terrifying as well. There you go. Definitely a close encounter of some 
kind and clearly did affect the witness. Perhaps it's a spiritual encounter involving some kind 
of perhaps angelic entity. I don't know. It's very hard to categorize some of these cases. Again, she 
did report it to a UFO centers. So, I'm including it here. Uh, and I have heard of similar cases 
of people seeing orbs and having them enter into their body. I know of one case where that happened 
to a gentleman and he was healed. So, this does seem to be intentional and yet there's this weird 
random quality to it. Her lifting up the blinds and that's when it happened. Which makes me wonder 
if what if she hadn't turned around and, you know, opened the kitchen blinds, would this not have 
occurred or was this all planned and pre-ordained? Very hard to say. I also find it super interesting 
that this incident occurred when these two were having a very profound and philosophical 
conversation about religion and God and this kind of thing because that is a pattern we see in a 
number of these cases. An encounter occurs at a sort of pivotal moment in a person's life. I don't 
know. There you go. 10 cases close encounters of the second kind. I think you'll agree that 
these are all truly fascinating and have some really interesting aspects to them that we 
have yet to fully understand and that makes them profoundly important. I've said it so many times, 
but I think these UFO encounters have so much to teach us that offers us an opportunity to learn so 
much about what's going on beyond Earth. It's clear to me that we are not alone. How do you 
explain these cases? If these aren't craft, what are they? You know, something is obviously going 
on here that deserves much more study, much more attention. And I know a lot of you out there are 
having these encounters because this is another thing I keep repeating, but it's so important. One 
in a hundred people maybe report their encounter to perhaps MUFON, Mutual UFO Network, or New Fork, 
the National UFO Reporting Center. And that's just in the United States. Between those two, 
they have some 200 to 300,000 documented cases. And I'm not even talking about CUFOS or NIKAP 
or APRO or the many, many other UFO reporting centers in the United States alone. So yeah, 
millions of documented cases. There's no doubt this subject is real. So I'm glad it's finally 
getting some attention at least. And we're moving beyond the skepticism and the ridiculing and the 
gaslighting of UFO witnesses because definitely it's no joke to those who have this experience. 
So that's it for today. Thanks so much guys. I really appreciate you guys watching. I'll be 
doing more humanoid cases of course, but again close encounters of the second kind are just as 
important. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope you're doing well. And until next time, keep 
asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Don't believe me. Do your own research. 
This is going on. Most important of all, keep having fun. I will see you next week. Bye for now.
