Almost everything we know about extraterrestrials comes from one source: the contactees, the people 
who have had face-to-face contact. The onboard UFO experience remains controversial, and yet there 
are many thousands of firsthand accounts coming from across the world. Cases reach back decades. 
They contain striking commonalities that argue strongly for the veracity of these accounts. This 
video presents seven astonishing and shocking cases, each offering a tantalizing glimpse into the 
very heart of the UFO phenomenon. These cases offer us an unparalleled opportunity to learn 
firsthand about life beyond Earth.

I REMEMBER IT LIKE YESTERDAY. One night in June 1976, two siblings (a 10-year-old boy and his little 
sister) were walking to their home in LaPorte, Texas when a brilliant object appeared overhead. 
Moments later, it was landing a short distance away, revealing itself to be a craft. A door opened 
and a tall gray alien emerged and pulled the two children onboard. Both recall communicating 
telepathically and being examined by the ETs. As they were being examined, they blacked out and woke 
up at the spot where they had been taken. It was now 3:00 am, much later than it had been. Both 
siblings agreed never to talk about what happened to anyone.

A CALM I CAN’T EXPLAIN. On September 7, 1980, Gene and May Gautreau were hunting in the wilderness 
of south-eastern Wyoming. On the evening in question, they woke up to see strange lights outside 
their tent. Despite the strange lights, they found themselves going to sleep. The next morning, 
they found their tent inexplicably littered with leaves and dirt. Learning about the phenomenon 
of missing time, they agreed to try hypnosis. They recalled that tall gray ETs came to their tent 
and guided them into a craft where they underwent a strange examination. Following the encounter, 
they began to experience a variety of unexplained and psychic events.

EXAMINED BY ALIENS. One evening in January 1990, a teenager from Curitiba Brazil saw a brilliant 
golden sphere hovering overhead. He found himself paralyzed for a moment as it quickly darted away. 
Later that same year, the boy saw ETs in his bedroom. After more strange events, he elected to try 
hypnosis. He was taken back to his sighting of the golden sphere and recalled being levitated by 
beam of light into the craft. He met short gray ETs who conducted a thorough examination. Before 
releasing him, they showed him strange images he couldn’t understand.

I WASN’T HARMED IN ANY WAY. In the summer of 1993, a woman was shocked when she had a very vivid 
dream of, short, gray-skinned aliens coming into the bedroom of her home in Paulsboro, New Jersey, 
and pulling her onboard a craft. Inside she was subjected to a thorough physical examination before 
being released. She had never heard of UFO abductions and assumed it was a strange waking dream. 
But over the next week, she had the same exact dream every night. Later, she saw accounts of people 
who claimed to have been abducted, and she realized her “dream” matched exactly what people were 
describing.

LET ME REMEMBER. One evening in Spring 2005, a woman was in the bedroom of her home in Wallingford, 
Connecticut when her bedroom door began rattling. At the same time, she heard a telepathic message 
to come to the door. Standing up, she found herself face-to-face with a short gray alien. As it 
spoke telepathically to her asking her to follow, she said she would only agree if she was allowed 
to remember her encounter. She recalled being taken outside her home and into a craft. She saw her 
home and the entire planet recede, and was then taken to an exam room. She recalled little else 
except waking up several hours later.

“WE ARE LOOKING AT YOUR DNA.” One evening in April 2013, a young man was amazed to see a UFO 
outside his home in Pleasantville, New Jersey. Following the sighting, he began to have a feeling 
of being watched. Three weeks later, he found himself taken from his bedroom into a craft where 
he was examined by gray aliens. He saw many other people onboard, including his sister. He was 
able to hold a short conversation with the ETs who revealed why the man had been taken and 
where the ETs came from.

IT WASN’T A DREAM. On the night of August 11, 2014, a man from Massillon, Ohio, was suffering from 
depression when he found himself inside a craft being examined by 6-foot-tall gray aliens. He 
asked the ETs why they had taken him and received a very puzzling answer. The ETs proceeded to 
perform a frightening procedure which caused him to pass out. Upon awakening back in his bedroom, 
he found a mysterious and painful scar on his foot. He is still seeking answers about what happened 
to him.

These seven cases display many of the common patterns we see with onboard UFO encounters, and yet 
each also contains unique elements which show that we still have much to understand about 
extraterrestrial contact.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of 
UFOs and the Paranormal. Today I'm going to be talking about my absolute favorite aspect of 
eupfology and that is onboard UFO encounters. The title of today's episode is let me remember seven 
astonishing onboard UFO encounters. I have seven cases for you today dating from 1976 up to 2014. 
One is from outside of the United States, Brazil, and six are from inside the United States, 
including Connecticut, two from New Jersey, one from Ohio, one from Texas, 
and one from Wyoming. I think these cases are very important. I wish they were taken more 
seriously because really everything we know about extraterrestrials comes from these kinds of cases. 
These cases have the most information about who these ETs are, where they come from, 
and why they are here. Of the seven cases I'm presenting today, two do involve multiple 
witnesses. Only two involve the use of hypnosis. So, we can put to rest any explanations that say 
these cases are false memory syndrome derived only from hypnotic regression. Simply not true. Five of 
these cases are fully conscious encounters. So I think these cases are tremendously important and 
that's why I do this research and why I like to focus on onboard cases whenever possible. 
So let's just get started. The first case I'd like to talk about today I call I remember it 
like yesterday. This occurred in June of 1976 in Leaport, Texas. It involves two witnesses, two 
siblings. And this is a really interesting case. I think the witnesses in this case had absolute 
proof that this was a real encounter. Not only because they shared this amazing experience, but 
they had physiological evidence as well as landing traces indicating that yes, this was a physical 
event that happened to them. This case involves two siblings, a brother and a sister, who shared 
a somewhat harrowing onboard UFO encounter when they were both very young kids. I've given them 
the pseudonyms Marcy and Mitch. Mitch was about 10 years old and Marcy was a few years younger. 
It was one day in June 1976 that they had gone to visit their grandmother and afterwards they were 
walking back to their home in Leaport, Texas. It was evening and Mitch, the older brother, 
was pointing out various constellations to Marcy and teaching her what they were. They were in a 
field by their home when, without warning, a UFO appeared overhead. As Marcy says, we saw a 
gold colored light come from the south and hover over us. I thought it was an airplane at first, 
but as it got closer, I realized it wasn't making any noise. I remember being afraid, but my brother 
was excited. So her brother Mitch looked up at the object in amazement and shouted out, "Oh wow, 
they are real." Marcy was a little bit panicky and afraid. So she grabbed his arm and tried to pull 
him to the house. But he just laughed and said, "Calm down. They won't hurt us." As Marcy says, 
he was my brother, so I trusted him to protect me. I stood behind him as the light came to the ground 
and landed. Now, per Marcy, this craft looked black. It had a shape that was hard for her 
to describe, kind of like a triangle or a pyramid that was missing the top section. She said it had 
a couple of windows in the midsection, and the bottom of the craft emitted a green blue light, 
which shone directly down onto the ground. This craft didn't actually land, but was hovering about 
one or two feet above the ground. And as soon as it stopped moving, an opening appeared on 
the side facing them. And at that point, a tall, slender being emerged from the opening, and began 
to approach the two children. As Marcy says, the being looked almost human with a large odd-shaped 
head, almond eyes the color of absolute darkness, and a small slit below where the nose slits were. 
It was very tall compared to my brother, maybe six or seven feet. When it exited the ship, 
I heard a noise like a soft murmuring bunch of voices. I was immediately soothed. I felt suddenly 
sleepy, but then the entity took my hand and my brother's hand. I don't remember it walking to us, 
but I remember how cold its hand was and how rubbery it felt. I felt like I was floating. It 
was taking us to its ship. We went inside and the slot closed behind us. So both children now found 
themselves inside this craft in an environment that was totally unfamiliar to them. And there 
were more of these tall beings inside. As Marcy says, they took us to a room where my brother was 
taken by another being and I was led to a table. I screamed for my brother, but the being picked 
me up and sat me on the table, placed his fingers on my eyes, and I couldn't move or talk anymore. 
I was laid on the table and my clothes were taken off. I remember there being a soft pink light and 
three beings in the room with me. There was a straw-like tool hanging above me, 
that one being put against my belly button. I remember a searing pain below my belly button and 
smelling hot metal like copper. I screamed, but then the pain was gone. I looked towards one 
of the beings and saw my brother on the table near mine. He was looking at me with tears in his eyes, 
and I could hear his voice, but his lips weren't moving. So, speaking telepathically, 
Marcy heard her brother's voice in her mind saying, "I'm sorry. I was wrong. I love you." 
As Marcy says, I felt warm where before I was so cold. The being stopped moving as my brother and 
I talked without moving our lips. I would think at him and then hear his voice responding to me. 
We've never been able to do that before. After a few minutes, my brother looked away from me and I 
felt him slip away mentally. Then he screamed like he was being murdered. I thought they were killing 
him, but I couldn't see anything because one of the beings moved between us and started looking in my 
ears with a bright light. So, this physical exam was the scariest and most unpleasant part of 
the whole experience for Marcy, particularly when the beings physically touched her. As she says, 
"I remember the gray color of those three-fingered hands, the way they seemed to be rubber straws. 
The tips against my skin felt terribly similar to frog's flesh. They pried open my eyes when I tried 
to scrunch them shut and put a jelly substance in them. Then they stuck something up in my nose that 
hurt so bad I passed out." And that was the end of the encounter, or at least all that Marcy was 
able to recall happening. And as Marcy says, "When I woke up, the ship was gone. My brother was lying 
in the ditch a few feet from me, and I thought he was dead. I heard my mother calling from me and 
my brother, so I sat up and called back to her. She ran to me from our yard to where my brother 
was lying, and when she saw him, she screamed. She picked him up and grabbed my hand, carrying 
him into the house. She asked me what happened as she laid him on the couch. So Marcy was about to 
answer and talk about the encounter when she got a nose bleed. So she went and got a watch cloth 
for her nose while her mother washed Mitch's face with another cloth which woke him up. And Marcy's 
mother told him, "It's 3:00 in the morning. Why are you out at 3:00 in the morning? Why?" As Marcy 
says, "My brother told her about the craft, and I did, too." But she said she thought we were trying 
to make stuff up. She said it was obvious someone had beaten us up. We saw how bad our story upset 
her, so we agreed that it was the local bully that beat us up. After my brother went to bed, 
when she thought we were asleep, my brother came into my room and we talked about it and agreed not 
to talk about it again. But the next day, curious to see if there was any evidence of this craft, 
they hiked out into the yard looking for signs that anything had happened. And sure enough, they saw 
a little portion of grass that had been pressed down as if a heavy weight had been on 
top of it. But as they promised each other, the subject was not brought up again for many years. 
In fact, it wasn't until about 30 years later that they spoke about it, and Marcy decided to file an 
official report in 2015. As Marcy says, we kept it secret until now. It's been almost 30 years 
now and only recently have my brother and I spoken of the incident. I still remember it like it was 
yesterday and so does he. My heart really goes out to those two kids. Uh that was clearly a pretty 
traumatic event for them. I would love to speak to them because I am guessing that that was not 
a one-off. Usually when someone is taken on board, they have encounters throughout their life. hard 
to say for sure, but I would also suspect that, you know, contact being generational that perhaps 
they have relatives who've also had contact. But I'm glad that they found the courage to come 
forward. I'm really glad that they had each other to sort of verify their encounters because a lot 
of people don't. The vast majority of people who have this experience are alone when it happens. 
Definitely an important case. So now let's move to the next one which I call a calm I can't explain. 
This is another multiple witness case. This occurred on September 7, 1980 in southeastern 
Wyoming. The exact location is being kept secret. But what's interesting about this case is not only 
is it a multiple witness case, the witnesses came forward and allowed their real names to be used. 
It's a really fascinating case. This one does involve the use of hypnosis. But to me, what's 
super interesting about this case is what happened afterwards. This case was investigated by Dr. Leo 
Sprinkle, PhD, and was presented at the Rocky Mountain UFO Conference in 1981 by the principal 
witnesses. It took place not far from Bosler, Wyoming, which is the location of the famous Pat 
Mcuire Ranch, a well-known UFO hot spot. Pat McGuire has had a lot of UFO experiences and 
is quite well known in this field. At any rate, the witnesses were a married couple, Jean Goro, 
a machinist, and his wife May. They were on an elk hunting trip, and on the evening of September 7, 
1980, they retired to their tent for the evening. It was a warm night, so they left the tent flaps 
open. And about 500 a.m., Gene was awakened by a shuffling noise outside his tent. And as he says, 
I sat up and looked out the tent door, and there was a bright light about 30 ft above the ground 
behind the aspen trees. It was white and had red and green flashing lights on it. Jean immediately 
woke up his wife, May, and said, "What is that?" She replied, "I can't distinguish it. It's too 
bright. The next thing they noticed was a big orange object that looked kind of like the moon, 
but it clearly wasn't. It was illuminating the road and slowly moving towards the west. As Jean 
says, the first thing I felt was fear. I grabbed for a pistol and a light. I didn't know what it 
was. I wasn't thinking UFO. I was just thinking that there was someone out there. So, his wife 
spoke up and said, "You are not going out there." Jean stared at her for a moment, put the gun back, 
and said, "No, I'm not going out there." But what happened next? Both surprised and puzzled 
him. As Jean says, a calm that I can't explain came over both of us at the same time. Whatever 
was out there, we felt wasn't going to harm us. I guess we felt that we ought to go back to sleep 
with those strange lights in front of us. So, we both lay down looking out the door. At some point, 
May said, "The other light is gone. Now all the insides of the trees are all lit up." Now, 
despite the fact that this was obviously very unusual, Jean found himself casually saying, "Oh, 
yeah. Good night." And they both fell asleep. Jean describes what happened next. As he says, 
"We woke up three and a half hours later. When we did, my wife was complaining of a sore mouth. 
She couldn't move her jaw and the whole inside of the tent was covered with dirt and leaves. It was 
a new tent and we were pretty careful about it. We took off our shoes when we went into it. We 
didn't have any kids to track it in, so we know that we didn't track it in, but there sure was a 
pile of dirt in there. And my pistol was over at the other side of the tent under the table, the 
holster, and everything. I just felt strange, and I decided I wasn't going to elk hunt that day. 
So, Jean told her, "Let's get out of here." May agreed and they packed up and left. Driving down 
the road, Jean saw a dead cow with three vultures sitting on it, picking at it. Gene wanted to stop 
and take a closer look. May said it was fine, but told him, "I'm not going with you." So, 
he went to the cow and saw that it had a perfect circle cut into its chest. It was clear to him that 
the wound was not caused by predators, as Jean says. So, I went home kind of confused about 
everything that happened to us. Finally, they spoke about their experience to their friends 
Pat and Wanda Maguire, who recommended that they go visit Dr. Leo Sprinkle, who was, of course, 
an expert on UFO encounters. And after speaking with them and hearing about their experiences, 
Leo suggested regressive hypnosis. They agreed and over the next six weeks had a series of hypnosis 
sessions. These sessions revealed what had happened during the missing three and a half hours 
of time. They had both been taken on board a craft by apparent extraterrestrials. As Jean says, under 
hypnosis, it came out that they actually did come to our tent. There were three of them that my wife 
had seen standing outside and they were conversing in some manner trying to make us go with them, 
I guess. And I remember them coming into the tent and taking my wife. I just sat there. Go ahead. 
And I went next and I didn't fight them either. I don't remember seeing her, but I remember sitting 
inside a room near a table. They were using some sort of lighted probe on my ear and my stomach. 
So, Gan did get a good look at the UFO occupants and describes what appears to be tall grays. As 
Jean says, they looked like they had duct tape all over them, a silver gray type uniform. They were 
quite tall, up to six feet tall, some of them 5'7, very lean, large craniums, large eyes. I was a 
little perturbed. They wouldn't talk with me. They knew better, I guess. Jean also got a pretty good 
look at the room they were in. And as he says, I remember seeing the room. The room was kind 
of strange. It was ovalike. There was a big box in the center of it. It had sort of smoke inside 
of it. I don't know what the smoke was, but it was a clear plastic box. That was really all Jean was 
able to remember. And as he says, the next thing I knew, I woke up three and a half hours later. 
I guess this all took place in the time that we slept. But it was the aftermath of the encounter 
that was almost as strange as the encounter itself because in the year that followed, 
they began getting a series of strange phone calls. And every time they'd answer the phone, 
nobody would be on the line. It happened so often that Gene finally went down to the police station 
and had them put a tap on their phone. And despite an official investigation, 
they couldn't find anything unusual. The calls did stop after about a month and then they 
started up again. Another apparent after effect was the sudden appearance of very strong psychic 
abilities in them both. As Jean says, ESP has been involved with us. We started seeing things before 
they happened. I saw President Reagan get shot 20 minutes before it happened. My daughter did, too. 
I was at an archery club and I saw a guy's bow break 15 seconds before it broke. It snapped and 
hit him in the face. Just strange things are happening to us. Now, despite all this high 
strangess, ultimately, Jean and May feel that their encounters were beneficial. As Jean says, 
we do feel very positive about our lives, that things are going very well for us, and we feel that 
we have learned something. We don't understand what it is, but it is something 
that has helped us. We think that some catastrophe is going to happen, and we feel that Laram Peak is 
the place to go. Gene does report that there are many other things that happened to him that are 
related to this, but this is all he shared at the conference. We find that case particularly 
fascinating because these witnesses describe exactly what so many other contactees describe 
which is having a huge escalation of psychic abilities following their encounters. So I think 
that's clearly related. Kudos to them for coming forward. Not a lot of people can find the strength 
and courage to do that. So I am absolutely honored when people do come forward and share 
their encounters and even allow their real names to be used. It's another I think important case. 
All of these cases are tremendously important. One of these days Congress is going to have to admit 
that people are having direct contact because again this is the very heart of the UFO phenomena. 
These are the cases that offer us the greatest opportunity to learn so much. For that alone, they 
should be taken seriously. So, now let's move to the next case. This one is fairly straightforward, 
but it's still an interesting case. I call this one examined by extraterrestrials. This occurred 
on January 12, 1990 in Curativa, Brazil. This is a single witness case for the most part, 
though the witness's family does verify some of these events. Uh this is a really interesting case 
in terms of how the witness described recalling his event and what happened on board is also very 
interesting. This very interesting and compelling case comes from Jackson Kamargo of the groupo de 
estudos de pasquisas eupfologic deenas. In other words, the eupfology study and research group of 
campinas. It also appears in Mario Runell's book, Alien Abduction. It actually involves 
several incidents. In January of 1990, The Witness, a teenager by the name of Vanderlay, 
was at its grandmother's house in a rural area of Curatiba. One evening, he stepped out to use the 
outhouse and he saw a 12t wide metallic golden sphere floating high above his house. Frightened, 
he tried to run back to the house, but suddenly found himself unable to move. The last thing he 
could recall was this object rising quickly into the sky and disappearing into the distance. With 
several months later, in October that same year, Vanderlay awoke in the middle of the night and saw 
three bright figures standing at the bedroom door. He was again paralyzed as one of the entities 
approached him. He felt an intense cold and passed out. Following this, he began having a repetitive 
dream of being chased. And in the dream, he would lose his strength and collapse. And of course, 
the dream would end. It was seven years later in 1997, he had a vivid dream that he woke up, 
opened the backyard door, and saw a luminous floating object, a UFO. The next morning, 
he found the door was in fact wide open. This was a small clue that this might have been more than 
just a dream. And this was verified by his father. When other similar events continued to occur, 
Vanderlay finally decided to try hypnosis. Two sessions were conducted and under hypnosis, he was 
taken back to January 12, 1990 when he had stepped out of his grandmother's house and saw this golden 
sphere hovering and then darting away. But this time under hypnosis, he recalled that the sphere 
emitted a solid, coherent beam of opaque white light that struck him and levitated him upwards. 
He estimates that he was about 30 ft above the house. He could see everything in clear detail 
below him. The craft was metallic and had windows around it and an opening like a doorway. He was 
floated up through the opening where a shadowy being was waiting. Once inside this object, he saw 
another being. One being was in front of him and another behind and he was floated down 
this corridor to another door which opened into a small windowless room where he was placed on a 
sort of examination table. He said the interior was hot and he began to persspire heavily. He 
said the table was surrounded by strange machines and apparatus that he was unable to describe. But 
he now saw three beings who he did describe as short with disproportionately large heads, 
enormous black eyes, a small almost invisible mouth, brownish skin, and four fingers on each 
hand. He said their fingers were damp and rough. So this does sound like rays. The beings proceeded 
to examine his body, touching his arms and fingers. He said they used an instrument to scrape 
his back near his shoulder blades. They then poked something into his left ear. Vanderlay was then 
floated off the table out of the room to another dark room and he felt as though he was floated 
up towards the ceiling and it was then that he was shown enigmatic images seemingly projected 
down from the ceiling. He was really unable to describe them except for one which showed the 
face of a normal looking human, someone he did not recognize. During the hypnosis, he trembled 
throughout the entire session. The hypnosis then revealed that he was then returned to the spot 
where he had been taken and felt extremely cold. And that was all he was able to recall. Again, 
a fairly straightforward onboard UFO encounter. The event that most people will experience when 
taken on board is being physically examined. That does seem to be one of the primary reasons people 
are taken on board. That's exactly what this gentleman describes. And yes, it was recalled 
through hypnosis, but again, he had pretty good indications of absolute full full awake contact. 
I mean, he was awake when the three ETs entered into his room. Uh he was awake when he had this 
sighting. Uh there's other indications that this was an entirely physical experience, but certainly 
a fascinating case. So now let's move to the next one which I call I wasn't harmed in any way. This 
occurred in August 1993 in PSboro, New Jersey. It's a single witness case. This one was recalled 
consciously but as a dream is how the witness kind of felt that this experience was. That's how she 
explained it. It wasn't until she started hearing about other people's experiences that she realized 
how closely her quote dream matched other people's fully conscious experiences. And looking at the 
details that she described that match up so well with other encounters, I think it's pretty clear 
that this was a real experience that you can make up your own minds about it. The witness in this case 
is still looking for answers and admits that she remains unsure whether her experience was a 
dream or an actual encounter. But after watching a video about an onboard encounter, the similarities 
to her quote dream shocked her. As she writes, it raised the hair on my neck was almost exactly what 
happened to me. It was a summer night in 1993. She was in her home in PSboro, New Jersey, and she had 
this same exact quote dream for seven consecutive days in a row. The dream never varied in detail. 
It was always exactly the same. The witness is anonymous, so I'll call her Becky. But here she 
describes what she recalls from her quote dream, or as the case may be, a physical encounter. As 
Becky says, I would be awoken in the middle of the night. There would be three to five small 
grays about three or four feet tall. They had the large black eyes, no hair or noticeable clothing 
on their grayish bodies. They never spoke to me directly, but I knew I had to go with them. So, in 
her dream, Becky found herself inside what appears to be an extraterrestrial craft. As she says, 
I would be taken by these grays to a place that was very bright, almost like fluorescent lights, 
but with no light fixtures any place. All the doors and hallways seemed smooth, as if carved 
from a solid object. There were no sharp edges any place. After walking for a few minutes, 
we would go to another bright room with a table in the middle. I don't remember seeing any tools 
or windows. The table was very cold when I was directed to lie on it. So these are 
all details that other contactees describe again and again. Becky then describes a procedure that 
is very well known to contactees which is being examined by the extraterrestrials. As Becky says, 
another much larger greylike creature comes into the room and directs the smaller ones to leave. 
This one is very tall and almost humanlike. He reassures me that I will not be harmed and I 
will be returned home. and never spoke to me directly. He spoke to my mind and I remember 
being scared but not terrified. He did tests on my reflexes, eyes, mouth, tongue, and ears that I can 
remember. I wasn't harmed in any way as it told me. It also never told me why I was being taken, 
but when he was finished, he left and the other smaller grays returned to lead me back. 
I always finished with the smaller grays leading me back to my bedroom and placing me into bed. I 
would wake up the next morning as if nothing had happened. So at that time, Becky was not familiar 
with the idea of being taken on board a UFO and examined by gray ETS. So she really wasn't sure 
what to make of these dreams or memories. But it was clear to her that these were not normal dreams. 
And now hearing about other people who have had these same exact experiences, 
she believes it's entirely possible that she may have had an onboard encounter. But as Becky says, 
I'm not totally sure what happened to me. I've always wrote it off as dreams, but if these were 
dreams, they never were different. It was the same dream for about seven straight days. I've 
told this experience a time or two, and now I'm really curious as to what really happened. Was it 
dreams or was I taken? So Becky is still searching for answers. You can see how difficult it is for 
people to process these experiences from that case alone. People often think, you know, could this be 
a dream? Am I going crazy? Was this real? It's very difficult to process. So I fully understand 
how people have a difficult time coming forward or even sharing this with other people because 
they themselves have all kinds of questions. Almost always these kinds of cases raise more 
questions than answers. That's again one of the reasons I do th this research and present these 
cases because I know so many people out there, so many of you are having these kinds of encounters. 
So now let's move to the next one. I call this one Let Me Remember. This occurred one evening in 
spring 2005 in Wallingford, Connecticut. This one of all the cases I present today in this episode, 
I think this one is my favorite. It's a really poignant case. I found it super fascinating. 
The witness is clearly sincere and was able to have a conversation with the ET that took her on 
board. This amazing case comes from a woman who has requested anonymity and she admits that she 
herself is unsure about what happened to her. It was a warm spring night in 2005. She was in her 
home in Wallingford, Connecticut. It was after midnight and she was dozing in bed waiting for 
a friend to call when suddenly the windows began rattling. So she sat up in bed and immediately 
heard a telepathic message saying very clearly, "You will not be harmed. come to the door. Now, 
the witness is 4 foot 10 in disabled. She walks with a cane and this telepathic voice said, 
"Unlock the door." Now, at this point, she turned to her left and was amazed to see a humanoid 
creature looking at her. And as she says, it was about 5t tall, large black eyes with a large head, 
a skinny body. The thing that struck me at the time was the grayish white body. It wasn't the 
typical gray. I think it had only four fingers. The gray said again telepathically, "Unlock the 
door. You won't be harmed." The witness said at this point, "Fine, but I remember everything. You 
don't take my memories. You let me remember." I didn't hear a yes or no, but I felt like he 
understood me. So, I unlocked the door and went out. Now, at this point, she stopped and stared 
directly at the gray face to face, getting a very close-up look, and she asked the gray, "Can I 
touch you?" as she says. So, he held out his arm, very thin. My bones are thin, and his arm may have 
been more thin than even mine. I also noticed that it had arm hair like us, but unlike human hair 
that is soft and lays flat, it had very stiff hair that stood straight up. Its skin was smooth but 
sort of bumpy like a lizard's might feel. Didn't look like a lizard though. It had feet, legs, 
arms, and hands. So now the gray began to lead the witness out of her house into the field behind her 
home. She had her cane in her hand and used it to help her walk forward. And as she says, we started 
walking again. This time it rested his hand on my arm, but I felt like it was more to assert more 
control. Maybe to avoid more delays. Who knows? We walked to the end of the deck ramp, then down 
a grassy slope to the right. At the bottom, I looked up and I saw the outline of a very dark 
craft. I only saw it because the moon, which was mostly behind the clouds, barely lit up an outline 
of the craft. It had three lights, one towards each side and one in the corner. I only remember 
the one in the center, which was blue, pulsating a bit. The crystalline clear blue beam about 3 ft 
around came down. I noted that it didn't glow or radiate light outward like any normal light might. 
It seemed to cut through the night. Now, the gray told her, "Step into the center." And she did. She 
thought to herself how cool the light is. At this point, the gray spoke again, still telepathically, 
"Don't touch the light and keep your hands at your side." And at that point, the witness found 
herself being levitated into the craft, as she says. Then I went up. It got fuzzy there quick. I 
remember turning to see the same being standing to the left of a chair, and behind him was a 
screen. I saw my home, then in a flash, the Earth. Then I looked to my right and I saw to the far 
right the wall which looked like a liquid silvery material essentially melt away from right to left 
revealing an examination room. Now having been in many hospitals due to her disabled condition, 
the witness was very familiar with medical examinations and she immediately recognized the hospital-
like setting. She had long gotten over her fear of medical exams. As she says, "I've 
been in a ton of hospitals. I know what they look like. I was not remotely afraid. From there, I 
started walking towards it. I've been experimented on my whole life by human doctors. I didn't really 
care. The next thing I know, I was waking up in my bed, lying flat, covers over me. So, 
she looked at the clock and saw that it was now 300 a.m., at least an hour and a half later than 
it should have been. She immediately told herself that the whole experience must have been a dream. 
But she wondered if maybe it could have been real, too. As she says, "I have some nagging questions, 
like, why do I remember this dream so clearly? Why do I remember walking barefoot down the hall and 
outside?" More odd, why was that literally the only dream I have ever had where I could even 
see my feet or feel my legs? And why do I remember using my cane when in my entire life I have never 
had a dream where I used a cane ever. The witness is still somewhat reluctant to call the experience 
real, but she decided to report it in the hopes of getting some clarity. As the witness says, 
I just don't know. I am only doing this to find out if anyone has ever had a similar experience. 
I still believe it was most likely a dream, but I will say this, it was the most real dream I have 
ever had in my entire life. To the point that I still struggle with the question of was it a 
dream or not? So, like most people who have this kind of experience, the witness is left with more 
questions than answers. What an amazing case. Again, we see that pattern of people struggling 
to process their experience. She's trying to figure out, was this just a dream? Was it a 
real experience? Uh, she remains undecided even to this day apparently. And I think actually that 
that argues more for the credibility of the case because she's not insisting that this actually 
happened. Just judging from the details she describes, it matches so many other accounts. 
I personally think it's real. I can't say for sure. I didn't speak with the witness firsthand, 
but it's absolutely an astonishing case. Now, let's move to the next one. This is another 
really interesting case. I like this one because the witness was able to hold a conversation with 
the ETSs as he asked them why he'd been taken on board and he got an answer. I call this one we 
are looking at your DNA. This occurred on May 20, 2013 in Pleasantville, New Jersey. And it's just 
an amazing case in so many ways. You call the witness in this case Cody. That is a pseudonym. 
He reported his encounter only two days after it happened, writing, "Up until two nights ago, 
I've always been a skeptic of aliens and UFOs, but I feel lost and confused, and that's why I'm 
here." It was one evening at the end of April in 2013. Cody was outside his home and he was 
amazed to see something very unusual. This is in Pleasantville, New Jersey. And as Cody says, I saw 
an unidentified object that looked like a fireball in the sky. And since then, I have had a feeling 
like I am being watched. So this feeling persisted over the next three weeks. Then on the evening of 
May 20, 2013, Cody believes that he was taken on board an extraterrestrial craft. as he says, 
"As I was about to go to sleep, I saw something in my room through my peripheral vision. I don't 
remember going to sleep, but I do remember waking up in a metal room. I was lying on a metal bed and 
I was restrained. I struggled to turn my head and I saw many people lying in those metal beds 
like mine. I focused on one in particular, which I realized was my sister. It seemed that everyone 
was in some state of unconsciousness. At that point, I realized that something was very wrong 
and I was conscious of the scary situation I was in. I started to panic and tried to free myself. 
Now, Cody does not report seeing anything actually holding him down, but nevertheless, he was unable 
to move. And as he struggled, several short gray aliens appeared around him. As Cody says, at that 
point I realized I was surrounded by short beings. They were grayish in color and seemed oblivious to 
the fact that I was trying to fight my way out of the restraints. Suddenly, out of nowhere came a 
bright light, and another being appeared. This one was taller and had a more oval-shaped head with 
indentations in it. Was almost tan in color. It communicated with me telepathically. Now, 
at this point, Cody's fear left him, and a short conversation ensued. Cody asked the tall alien, 
"What are you doing with us?" And the ET replied telepathically, "We're looking at your DNA." Cody 
then asked, "Why are you doing this to us?" And the ET replied, "All humans have DNA, but not all 
humans have the same alien DNA." Cody continued to ask more questions which the tall ET answered 
and as Cody says I asked it where it was from and it said we come from Sirius and it also told me 
that they have been coming to me for a long time. At that point it disappeared and my fear returned 
and I started screaming from the top of my lungs. The next thing I remember is jumping up from my 
bed screaming waking up everyone in the house. I haven't slept for two nights now. What about 
that? Pretty darn fascinating. What's interesting to me about this case is it does display a pattern 
that I've seen over and over again where someone has a UFO sighting and then it's shortly after 
that that they are taken on board. And that's absolutely what happened to this gentleman. 
And yeah, an interesting case because he was able to hold a conversation with the ETSs who not only 
explained why they had taken him on board, but also where they came from. I am sure that there's 
a lot more information to that case. Uh, as with all of these cases, so what we're looking at is 
really only a brief glimpse of what's going on in these people's lives. Let's move to the next case. 
This is the last one in this compilation and super fascinating. I call this one it wasn't a dream. 
This occurred on August 11, 2014 in Masselon, Ohio. To me, the most fascinating aspect of this 
case is when it happened. At the time this person was taken on board, he was suffering somewhat of 
an a crisis, asking very deep questions about his life, why he was on Earth, and so forth. This is 
a pattern I see quite a bit. People are taken on board in moments in their life when there's a lot 
of change going on. Could be the birth of a child or the death of a loved one or a marriage or a 
breakup or anything like that. So that pattern is absolutely showing up in this case which I think 
you'll find really compelling. This report comes from Harold of Masselon, Ohio. That is a pseudonym 
as the witness is anonymous. His onboard encounter occurred at a time in his life when he was asking 
very deep questions about the meaning of his life. As Harold says, I did not believe in alien 
abduction before this happened. I know it wasn't a dream. I was at home lying in my bed writing 
a song. I was really depressed and I didn't know why I was still alive and what my purpose was. I 
wasn't tired or anything, but I guess I must have fallen asleep or something because the next thing 
I know, I'm lying on a bed. It was hard and felt like metal under my body. I was naked. So, after 
finding himself unclothed and lying on this table, the next thing Harold noticed is that he was not 
alone. As he says, I could only turn my head a little, and looking around, I saw gray beings, 
but not short. They were tall. I'd say about six feet. They had eyes the shape of almonds. They 
had no clothing on. They didn't walk. They moved so smoothly. I started to panic because three of 
them started towards me. All of a sudden, I get this voice in my head to turn to the right. So, 
Harold turned his head and was concerned to see alien-l lookinging equipment dangling above him. 
He said they looked almost like flexible tubes, but it was at this time he saw a tall being 
standing right next to him. And as Herald says, his head was gray. He had almond-shaped eyes, 
but his body was like liquid universe. He told me not to be afraid, but he didn't speak. It was like 
he was in my head speaking. All of the sudden, I get this sharp burning pain in my ankle. I tried 
to move. I tried to do something, but I was being held down by some force or maybe paralyzed. Again, 
this main being came right over me and looked down at me. I could feel tears going down my face. So 
speaking telepathically, Harold asked the being, "Why is this happening?" The being answered him, 
but Harold wasn't quite sure what this answer meant. As Harold says, he like smiled, 
but I didn't see the smile. I felt it. He told me that I needed to tell them something. I can't 
remember what I'm supposed to tell them, and I don't know who I'm supposed to tell it to. 
But looking back above him, Harold again saw the strange tubes hanging from the ceiling, 
and when he saw what happened next, he quickly became understandably alarmed. As Harold says, 
one of them started to slowly come down towards me. As it got to my right eye, it went from limp 
and soft to hard, and it had a point like a needle. As the needle type tube was about to 
enter my right eye, the main being put his hand on my forehead. The next thing I know, I was up 
and I'm looking out into space. I'm in a smaller UFO looking out at the main UFO. When I left the 
big UFO, I was in a little ship looking at it in space. The windows on the big cigar-shaped UFO 
looked like swirling water. So, Harold said that everything at this point looked a little hazy, 
and he felt somewhat anesthetized, and that's all he could really remember. As Harold says, 
the next thing I know, I'm laying back in my bed two hours later. My left ankle felt like it was on 
fire. Put my hand down there and felt a mark. It was diamond shaped. It looked like it had already 
started healing as a scar. For the next week, I had a hard time walking on that foot. Felt 
like something was burning inside my ankle. Two years later, Harold was still feeling some of the 
effects from this encounter. as he says, "It's now 2016. I still have the diamond-shaped scar, 
but it's very light. You can feel on my ankle where this thing is. I don't know what they did 
when they stuck that tube needle into my eye. I really want to find a way to remember what I am 
supposed to tell them, whomever them is." Ever since this, I have become a recluse. I want to 
know what happened to me that night, and why did they do these things to me? Will they visit me 
again? What do they want? An amazing case. And it again shows the pattern of how difficult it is to 
process these kinds of events. Uh he was affected on multiple levels. This witness physically, 
mentally, emotionally, spiritually. This is something that most people remember for the rest 
of their lives. If they actually do remember their encounter because there is good indications that 
some people don't remember this at all. Missing time can be seamless. I think there's a lot of 
people out there who are contacties and don't even know it. But again, we can put any theories that 
this is explainable only by hypnotic regression to rest. That's not true. This gentleman recalled his 
experience fully consciously as do many people. So yeah, these cases are tremendously important. 
They have so much to teach us. It definitely is time that they are taken more seriously. 
So that's it for today. I hope you've enjoyed this episode. Thank you very much for watching. 
I truly appreciate it. Until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching 
for the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun. and I will see you next week. Bye for now.
